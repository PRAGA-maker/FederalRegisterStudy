2014-30752,APHIS-2014-0018-0062,"April 15, 2015 <br/><br/>To Whom It May Concern:<br/><br/>The following are the comments of the Pennsylvania Livestock Marketing Association on the proposed rule regarding Approved Livestock Marketing Facilities (Docket No. APHIS-2014-0018). <br/><br/>We thank you for the chance to provide feedback on the proposed rule. While we appreciate the time and effort taken to update the regulatory scheme surrounding Approved Livestock Marketing Facilities, we feel that USDA missed the mark in components of this proposed rule that reduces ADT rule flexibilities for cattle moving to an Approved Livestock Marketing Facility. The proposal limits the flexibility to only cattle coming to the facility from a Farm of Origin. Additionally, defining Farm of Origin to the farm where livestock are produced or maintained for at least four months prior to movement is unnecessarily broad  restricting movement even more. <br/><br/>In Pennsylvania, most of our livestock markets do business with out-of-state customers on a regular basis. This is both a function of being a smaller state and of cattle movement patterns. Additionally, many of our customers selling at market are small producers who bring just one or a few head of cattle to market at a time. For these small producers, it would be extremely expensive to have to have a veterinarian visit the farm to write a health certificate, especially when you consider the fact the cost of this health certificate could only be spread out over a few animals at the most. <br/><br/>This added expense could drive producers to sell at a different market just to avoid crossing state lines. They also may consider selling out of the market environment where it is less likely animal health and livestock movement requirements. <br/><br/>This would lead to less traceability rather than more traceability. <br/><br/>Sincerely, <br/><br/>Pennsylvania Livestock Marketing Association <br/>",2015-04-16T04:00:00Z,2015-04-16T02:22:26Z,,PA,LMA,,,All Over,PA,United States,,,,false,0,,,0,0
2014-30752,APHIS-2014-0018-0059,"Dear Mr. Shea, <br/><br/>As the association representing local livestock auction markets in the state of South Carolina, we are writing to provide comments on the proposed rule regarding Approved Livestock Marketing Facilities (Docket No. APHIS-2014-0018). <br/><br/>Generally, we support the comments submitted by Dan Harris, president of the national Livestock Marketing Association. In particular, we share his concerns with the Farm of Origin changes to the ADT rule limiting the feasibility of us continue to do business with our out-of-state customers. Adult cattle coming into our markets are documented and inspected upon arrival, so this adjustment is unnecessary. <br/><br/>We also feel strongly that the agreement should remain in the regulation so markets have the ability to formally comment on any changes just as we are doing now. <br/><br/>In addition, we agree that the language in the proposed agreement should be adjusted so it is clear livestock markets are not solely responsible for all livestock movement and animal health requirements. Our producers, veterinarians, and animal health officials also play an important role. <br/><br/>Our final comment is unique to South Carolina. We have state inspectors that attend each of our livestock auctions. We feel this resource market owners should be able to be utilize, if they chose to do so, to help address the shortage of private veterinarians and increase traceability. This could be accomplished by allowing these state inspectors the ability to write health papers or alternative movement documents to keep livestock moving. <br/><br/>If you have any questions about these comments, please contact John Kissee at 770-596-0128. <br/><br/>South Carolina Livestock Marketing Association <br/>",2015-04-15T04:00:00Z,2015-04-15T21:25:18Z,,South Carolina,LMA,,,Columbia,SC,United States,,,,false,0,,,0,0

2014-30752,APHIS-2014-0018-0007,"The industry desperately needs these changes! As a Livestock Market operator in southern Michigan since 1956, we have seen many changes over the years, notably a decrease of Livestock Marketing options. We have several customers from northern Ohio that choose us to market their slaughter cattle. Requiring to have an IVCI issued by a vet for each consignment of slaughter cattle would not only be costly, but not necessary. These cattle go to slaughter and are inspected by USDA at their destination for harvest. To be an &quot;Approved USDA Livestock Facility&quot; to accept out of state slaughter cattle and be required to have a Vet at the site on sale days would serve no purpose. Our local vet on call would allow his/her services on the farms and not pin him/her down at our premise for 6 hours each sale day. These out of state consignments are currently and would be continued to be USDA back tagged, penned separate, not co mingled, and sent from our facilities to slaughter. In addition, they are individually identified with RFID or USDA approved metal ear tags. An &quot;Owner-Shipper&quot; statement to accompany the cattle is no problem for the farmers or truckers.

2014-30752,APHIS-2014-0018-0033,"To Whom It May Concern:<br/> <br/>I am writing to provide comments on USDAs proposed changes to the Approved Livestock Marketing Facilities and Animal Disease Traceability regulations (Docket No. APHIS-2014-0018).<br/> <br/>As the President and CEO of Clovis Livestock Auction, Im concerned about a couple pieces of this proposal. One major concern I have is with the market duties in the proposed Approved Livestock Marketing Facility agreement. To me, it seems USDA would like markets to serve as the police of animal movement requirements. This is a government role that should not be passed on to private businesses. While we work with our buyers and sellers to help them meet requirements by having a veterinarian at our market, enforcing regulations is not a role markets should have to take on. The markets duties in the Approved Livestock Marketing Facility agreement should be adjusted to reflect this.<br/> <br/>I also am concerned about the portion of the proposed rule making changes to what is required to bring adult beef cattle and dairy cattle of any age across state lines to an Approved Livestock Marketing Facility. Our auction market is located in eastern New Mexico, close to the Texas border. Due to this, we have many customers crossing state lines to sell or buy cattle.<br/> <br/>Under the proposal, out-of-state producers selling cattle 18 months of age or older would have to get a health certificate before bringing these cattle to sell at our market, unless the cattle are coming from the farm where they are born or have been for four months.  Getting a veterinarian to visit a farm and write a health certificate can be expensive. In this rule, USDA has recognized that access to large animal veterinarians is a very real problem.  My concern is that USDA could be driving customers away from selling out our market by requiring health certificates prior to arrival. This is unnecessary as we have a veterinarian at our market and also record needed traceability information when cattle arrive.<br/> <br/>I believe the farm of origin piece of the rule would have a negative impact on my business and put livestock markets that happen to be located close to a state line at a competitive disadvantage. Because of this, my strong recommendation is that USDA does not move forward this component of the proposed rule.<br/> <br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/> <br/>Sincerely,<br/>Charlie Rogers",2015-04-14T04:00:00Z,2015-04-13T21:21:36Z,,Charles,Rogers,,,Clovis,NM,United States,,,,false,0,,,0,0

RE: Comments regarding Docket No APHIS-2014-0018, Proposed Rule on Livestock Marketing Facilities  
On behalf of the Missouri Department of Agriculture, please consider these comments regarding Docket 
No APHIS-2014-0018, Proposed Rule on Livestock Marketing Facilities. 
Thank you for allowing comments on the proposed rule. Missouri is ranked in the top 10 in many 
livestock categories and currently has 106 state-federal licensed markets.  After careful review of the 
proposed changes, we would like to make the following recommendations and suggestions. 
Proposed Revisions to Part 71 
Currently livestock markets are licensed and approved through a joint cooperative effort of state and 
federal authority; we would hope this relationship would continue in the future.  However, it is unclear 
that this is the intent of the proposed regulations with references to section 8308 of the Animal Health 
Protection Act (AHPA, 7 U.S.C. 8301, et seq.) and the statement “At the discretion of APHIS, a State 
animal health official could also be a cosignatory on the agreement”. Additionally, the Approved 
Livestock Marketing Agreement is stated to be between a livestock marketing facility and APHIS.  It 
appears under the proposed regulations APHIS is extending its authority to livestock market facilities 
that are not federally licensed via their authority under the Animal Health Protection Act.  It would seem 
to be an overreach of federal authority if the facility is not meeting the marketing requirements to be 
federally licensed under 9 CFR 71.20. We sincerely hope this does not set precedence for the utilization 
of the AHPA from this point forward. 
The proposed market agreement gives the impression the state will be engaged in the process. The 
livestock markets are currently licensed in our state by the state department of agriculture under the 
direction of the state veterinarian. However, we will again emphasize the need to keep the state in any 
agreements between APHIS and the livestock markets.   
Proposed Revisions to Part 86 
In Section 86.1, the “farm of origin” is defined as the location of the animals for a period of 4 months 
prior to movement.  How will livestock market owners be able to verify the animals comply with the 
“farm of origin” criteria upon arrival at the livestock market?  Would this mean without verification the 
animals would not qualify to move interstate without an ICVI and official identification to a livestock 
market that is also a “tagging site”? We feel this would be an undue burden on the livestock market 

and/or the accredited veterinarian at the market with little or no way of verification possible other than 
the seller’s word.  
In Section 86.5, we agree with the clarification to allow animals to move interstate to a livestock market 
facility without an ICVI or owner-shipper statement when the livestock market is collecting all the 
necessary information that would normally be captured on a movement document if this is allowed by 
the state of destination. 
Proposed Revisions to the Approved Livestock Marketing Agreement 
We are opposed to the removal of the requirement that an accredited veterinarian, State or APHIS 
representative must be on the premises at all times on sale days to perform duties in accordance with 
State and Federal regulations.  In the event APHIS feels the need no longer exists for a veterinarian to be 
present at the livestock market on sale days, we would like clarity to ensure the state’s authority would 
be recognized.   
We believe the presence of an accredited veterinarian is crucial to ensure the health and welfare of 
animals marketed through the facility.  In addition, it ensures we have individuals who are experts in the 
field of veterinary medicine available to provide early detection of disease in our livestock markets. The 
livestock markets assemble animals from a variety of locations within the United States and co-mingle 
and disperse them throughout the United States after the sale.  To protect the health of our animals it is 
absolutely critical through early detection that we have veterinarians on site to examine animals 
entering into commerce through our livestock markets to enhance or ensure early detection of disease. 
The presence of the accredited veterinarian at our livestock markets ensures that livestock market 
employees are adhering to the federal regulations.  The absence of this individual would leave the 
livestock market owners to self regulate. Would they also be required to self report any variance from 
the federal requirements?  Would APHIS rely on the biannual inspections to ensure compliance?  
Currently in the event of a disease trace, the livestock market veterinarian is relied upon and in many 
cases expected to provide the required information to authorities.  
The lack of veterinarians in certain regions of the United States should not be a driving force to change 
the requirement of an accredited veterinarian to be present in the livestock markets. Instead it should 
enhance the ability of a veterinarian to provide large animal veterinary service to livestock producers in 
the region.  The livestock market veterinarians in our state are paid through the services they provide to 
the livestock producers, thus serve as a means to improve the marketability of the animals and are 
considered an asset to the livestock producers and markets.  In addition, they ensure the livestock 
moving through the livestock market are handled in accordance to current animal handling standards 
accepted by NCBA and BQA Guidelines.  Their presence ensures animals that are injured during 
transport or at the livestock market are dealt with swiftly and humanely to prevent prolonged suffering. 
It is unclear who the authority would be at the livestock markets to determine when animals are known 
to be infectious, exposed, high-risk, etc. as referenced in III.A. 2, 5, and 6 if accredited veterinarians are 
not readily available as currently required.  The requirement for veterinarians to be present on the day",0,0

Docket Number: APHIS-2014-0018
Federal Register Vol. 80 No.1 January 2, 2015
Subject: Proposed Rule Livestock Marketing Facilities
I have been employed by the USDA-APHIS-VS for 36 years as an Animal Health Technician 
and 10 of those years as an Animal Identification Coordinator. I am submitting, for your 
consideration, my comments as a private citizen on the proposed changes to the Livestock 
Marketing Facilities regulations. The Livestock Marketing Facilities regulations continue to 
cause undue hardships to an important entity in the cattle industry, the Licensed Livestock 
Dealer.
I am referencing the statement in the Proposed Rules for Livestock Marketing Facilities 
under “Proposed Revisions to Part 86” paragraph 9:
After reviewing the relevant provisions of the agreement in 71.20 and how they have been 
implemented operationally, we agree with producers and State animal health officials that 
the information maintained by approved livestock marketing facilities for all livestock that 
enter the facility often includes all categories of information that are required on the 
owner-shipper statement. Thus, we are proposing to allow cattle and bison to be moved 
interstate to an approved livestock marketing facility without an accompanying owner-
shipper statement provided a State animal health official has waived the need for the owner-
shipper statement and all of the information required for an owner-shipper statement is 
recorded as soon as the cattle or bison are offloaded at the approved livestock marketing 
facility and this is maintained in accordance with the record retention requirements located 
in 86.3.
A Licensed Livestock Dealer is required by state laws to have a valid livestock dealer 
license in each state that they engage in the business of dealing in cattle. They must identify 
slaughter cattle and keep a record book. This record book contains the same information that 
is required on the owner shipper statement. Every cattle transaction, listing of official ID and 
backtag numbers, the date of purchase, repossessed, sold, traded or loaned, or from whom 
obtained and to whom the cattle are transferred is to be recorded in their dealer record book. 
There is a united concern among License Livestock Dealers that their sources of business and 
income would become public knowledge and jeopardized their business if they are required 
to provide the Livestock Marketing Facilities (LMF) with the names and addresses of the 
farms/producers where they obtain cattle from, as required with the owner-shipper statement 
regulations. By requiring the dealers to provide this information to the Livestock Marketing 
Facilities they are providing important confidential information to potential competitors, with 
no added benefit to the traceability system.

Final comments:
I propose that the requirement of the owner-shipper statement be modified so that the owner 
shipper statement does not require the name and address of where the animals originate for 
licensed livestock dealers. The LMF would be responsible for maintaining a record of which 
licensed livestock dealer delivered the animals to the LMF. The traceability can then be 
completed by using the licensed dealer records.
I respectfully submit for your consideration,

Comments on Proposed Rule Change for Livestock Marketing Facilities
Docket No. APHIS-2014-0018
RIN 0579-AE02
           Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Proposed Rule Change for Livestock 
Marketing Facilities. I am commenting as the Wyoming State Veterinarian, employed by the 
Wyoming Livestock Board. The board is a seven-member, governor-appointed board with 
statutory authority to license and regulate livestock markets in Wyoming. The board’s executive 
director has statutory authority to appoint a veterinarian, subject to board approval, as an 
authorized veterinarian for livestock markets. The proposed rule changes for livestock marketing 
facilities are of interest to the board and to me since we share the responsibility of maintaining 
the health and protecting the ownership of Wyoming livestock.
The following comments express our concerns, questions, and suggestions to the draft 
proposal:
Section 71.1 Definition - The definition of “Approved Livestock Marketing Facility” 
should include language consistent with that in the definition of “Livestock Marketing Facility” 
by adding the words, “for sale or sale purposes,” between “assembled” and “and that has been 
approved under §71.20.”
In the paragraph, “Application of USDA Approved Back tags,” it is important to consider 
both the retention of the backtag and the safety of the person who is responsible for applying the 
tag. Both are of paramount importance. Also of significant importance is back tag collection at 
slaughter so recovery of the tag must also be highly considered. For best retention and recovery, 
we recommend that the back tag be placed on the dorsum at the level of the last thoracic 
vertebrae. APHIS should cooperate with FSIS to provide a tool that will retrieve a back tag if it 
is beyond the reach of personnel on the slaughter line.
It should be noted that, traditionally, back tag retention has been addressed with double 
tagging when all else fails.  However, when applied properly, one tag has proven to be more than 
sufficient as demonstrated in some regions where commingled, in-weight sales are the norm.
Additionally, because of regional differences, we suggest that any tag placement language in the 
rule be in the form of recommendations and guidelines, leaving any rules or requirements up to 
the state animal health officials.  Finally, APHIS may want to consider a “minimum back tag 
retention rate” as a requirement for the facility permit.
In the first paragraph of proposed revisions to Part 86, it states that cattle or bison are 
allowed to be moved through no more than one approved livestock marketing facility and then

directly to a recognized slaughtering establishment, and implies that the back tag may be applied 
at the recognized slaughtering establishment. We disagree with allowing cattle or bison moving 
through an approved livestock marketing facility to be back tagged at the recognized 
slaughtering facility. Once cattle or bison are moved through a market and are commingled, if 
they are not back tagged at the market, traceability is severely compromised. Such animals 
should be back tagged at the approved livestock marketing facility before moving to slaughter. 
Any cattle or bison moving through a market should be tagged before there is any chance of 
commingling, loss of origin identity, or leaving the first market. Conversely, if cattle or bison are 
moved directly from the farm of origin to a recognized slaughtering facility without any 
commingling, it should be allowed that the tags be applied at the slaughter facility; otherwise, all 
animals must be identified prior to shipment to maintain traceability.
Recognizing that the ADT rule only applies to animals crossing state lines, the livestock 
marketing facility rule does have authority on animals remaining within the state.  We propose 
that the rule state that all breeding class cattle be identified with either official ID or a USDA-
approved back tag prior to leaving the facility (in addition to any ADT requirements).  We also 
ask that it be required that USDA-approved back tags can only be removed under the following 
conditions:
1) At slaughter
2) When replaced with another USDA-approved back tag and the two recorded and kept on 
file for five years with the person /entity to which the replacement tag was issued.
3) When correlated with an official ID tag at an approved tagging site and kept on file for 
five years.
The paragraph, “Meaning of Directly to an Approved Livestock Marketing Facility,” 
states that the exemption pertains only to cattle and bison moved interstate from their farm of 
origin to an approved livestock marketing facility. Please clarify whether this exemption pertains 
only to cattle or bison intended strictly for movement to slaughter, or if it pertains to cattle or 
bison intended for other purposes such as breeding. Please also clarify whether cattle and bison 
moving directly from the farm of origin to an approved livestock marketing facility in the same 
state, and which are then moved from that first approved livestock marketing facility to a second 
approved livestock marketing facility in another state, are required to be qualified for interstate 
movement with back tags or official identification at the first approved livestock marketing 
facility and if an ICVI is required.
Meaning of Directly to an Approved Livestock Marketing Facility:   86.5 c 1&2 still are 
not clear.  It needs to be clarified that an owner-shipper statement is required (in lieu of a CVI) in 
all cases except farm to slaughter.  It also needs to clarify that the owner-shipper statement can 
be waived by the state vet in any of the cases if conditions are met by the livestock market.  We 
propose the following:
(c) Cattle and bison. Cattle and bison moved interstate must be accompanied by an 
ICVI unless:
(1) They are moved directly from their farm of origin to a recognized slaughtering 
establishment.
(2) They are moved directly from their farm of origin to an approved livestock 
marketing facility with an owner- shipper statement and then directly to a recognized 
slaughtering establishment. A State animal health official may waive the requirement for 
an owner-shipper statement to accompany such cattle and bison, provided that:
(i) All the information required for the owner-shipper statement is recorded as soon 
as the cattle or bison are offloaded at the approved livestock marketing facility; and",0,0

Livestock should be tagged as soon as they arrive at the marketing facility from farm of origin whether interstate or intrastate.  Veterinarians have not been at the local sale barns all day around here in years and the rules should reflect this. Having a veterinarian &#39;on call&#39; is fine.,2015-01-05T05:00:00Z,2015-01-03T02:05:42Z,,Elizabeth,Mitchell,,,Brush Creek,TN,United States,,,,false,0,,,0,0

Your proposed rule stood out to me as I had previously taken an animal law seminar in which I wrote a paper focusing, in part, on the interstate transportation of rodeo broncs. In doing so, I spoke about the federal Twenty-Eight Hour Law (49 USC 80502) as well as the regulations adopted by the United States Department of Agriculture as mentioned in 9 C.F.R. 89. Noticing that your proposed rule overlaps with much of research I encountered in writing my paper, I would offer the following comments as to the proposed revision to Part 71.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>I understand the practicality of your decision to revise 71.20 as simply requiring a veterinarian on-call rather than on the premise at all times, however I am concern that the language in this section is too board as to who determines whether an animal may need an interstate certificate of veterinary inspection (ICVI) before leaving the facility after sale. For example, should this determinate be left up to someone who profits financially from having these animals shipped to another facility despite their health conditions, I have serious concerns for its vague phrasing.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Further, the restatement in 71.20(a) of 8303 of the Animal Health Protection Act (AHPA, 7 U.S.C. 8301 et seq.) stating that APHIS may carry out operations and measures to control, or eradicate any pest or disease of livestock also seems rather ambiguous. I understand that should pests or disease be detected in livestock, there is a strong health and safety interest in having them eradicated, however being a strong animal welfare advocate I would simply ask that this be done as humanely as possible by adding said language to your restatement.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Jennifer Trunk",2015-01-15T05:00:00Z,2015-01-13T19:01:13Z,,Jennifer,Trunk,,,Plantation,FL,United States,,,,false,0,,,0,0

2014-30752,APHIS-2014-0018-0011,"Not sure if this relates directly to the proposed changes, but two points:<br/><br/>1) The ADT Rule has created a potential &quot;traceability loophole&quot; in allowing cattle to move interstate to an approved tagging site with no ID and no CVI. This should happen only if the receiving tagging site is required to tag with official ID and maintain records in such a manner that animals are traceable back to the state and ship-from location. For example, Virginia allows breeding age cattle to be imported with no ID and no CVI if they are moving to an approved market and tagging site in VA, but they require that cattle are tagged with 840 RFID and usually a back tag that can be correlated with seller/buyer records in market files. The 840 tag provides traceability going forward; the back tag provides backward traceability.<br/><br/>2) It is difficult to get dairy calves/steers tagged with official ear tags at Virginia markets due to number of animals handled. If these animals are moving to other states in a fairly direct manner (similar to cull cattle), back tags may provide adequate traceability if correlated with seller/buyer records on both ends (shipping and receiving locations). Current back tags could (if appropriate) also be scanned with bar code readers to improve efficiency and accuracy of data capture. For example, dairy calves/steers in VA tagged with back tags and correlated to seller/buyer records; animals could be tagged with ear tags in receiving state, which should be correlated with VA back tags. Back tags are cheap, unique when paired with a date and location, stay on fairly well for short-term movements and are easier to capture than metal tags.",2015-02-18T05:00:00Z,2015-02-17T22:47:21Z,,Rick,Odom,,,Charlottesville,VA,United States,,,,false,0,,,0,0

RE: Docket No. APHIS-2014-0018, Proposed Rule on Livestock Marketing Facilities 
On behalf of The Humane Society of the United States and our members and supporters, thank 
you for the opportunity to submit public comment in response to the proposed rule regarding 
regulations governing approval of facilities that receive livestock moved in interstate commerce.  
These comments address the proposal to amend the Approved Livestock Marketing Facility 
Agreement under §71.20 to remove the requirement that an accredited veterinarian, State 
representative, or APHIS representative must be on the premises at all times on sale days.1 
The Federal Register Notice states that the requirement should be removed because when the 
rule was established, communicable livestock diseases were more prevalent in the United States, 
and it was more crucial for a veterinarian, APHIS Representative, or State representative to be on 
site to process paperwork, conduct testing, and ensure the isolation of high-risk livestock to 
prevent disease transmission.  However, communicable livestock diseases certainly still exist.2 In 
fact, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations describes animal 
transport as “ideally suited for spreading disease,” given that animals may originate from 
different herds or flocks and are “confined together for long periods in a poorly ventilated 
stressful environment.”33   The presence of a veterinarian or state/APHIS representative has 
utility beyond completing paperwork.  These individuals are qualified to identify problems and 
evaluate risks at livestock marketing facilities before they become larger problems. 
The HSUS urges APHIS to consider how susceptible livestock being moved through livestock 
marketing facilities are, not only to communicable disease, but to stress, injury, and inhumane 
treatment.  Veterinarians in particular are uniquely situated to intervene at livestock marketing 
facilities if needed to protect the safety of the food supply, or the well-being of animals at the 
facilities.

ASPCA, HSUS Re: Docket No. APHIS-2014-0018 
Operators of a livestock marketing facility have a financial stake in the animals at the facility, 
which could lead to under-reporting of animal disease.  Laypersons are also much less qualified 
to make a determination that an animal presents a disease risk than veterinarians or state/APHIS 
representatives. By transferring authority over inspecting livestock for diseases from 
state/APHIS representatives or veterinarians to individuals operating livestock marketing 
facilities, the proposed rule opens the door to potential conflicts of interest that put public and 
animal health at risk.  
Cost savings are not a sufficient justification for the increased threats to public health and animal 
health and welfare that this proposed rule presents.  APHIS should retain the requirement in the 
Approved Livestock Marketing Facility Agreement that a veterinarian, State representative, or 
APHIS representative be present at livestock marketing facilities during sale hours.  Failure to 
retain this requirement could amount to a violation of 7 U.S.C. 8301(5)(B), and thus subject the 
agency to potential litigation under the Administrative Procedure Act.  7 U.S.C. 8301(5)(B) is 
the authorizing legislation for 9 C.F.R. 71.2, and tasks APHIS with the duty “to protect the 
agriculture, environment, economy, and health and welfare of the people of the United States.”  7 
U.S.C. 8301(5)(B).  Failure to require a veterinarian, State representative, or APHIS 
representative to be present during operating hours would pose harm to health and welfare of the 
animals and the safety of the food chain.  
Particularly as APHIS proposes to change other requirements for transport and identification in 
this proposed rule, the supervision of a veterinarian or state or APHIS representative could prove 
invaluable in ensuring that APHIS-approved livestock marketing facilities represent safe 
facilities with sufficient oversight to ensure the safety of the animals moving through them and 
the safety of the agricultural economies that depend on them.

I am writing for the Indiana State Board of Animal Health (BOAH) to comment on the proposed 
rule governing livestock market facilities, docket number APHIS-2014-0018. 
Veterinarians at Markets 
The proposed rule would allow approved livestock marketing facilities to have a veterinarian on 
· cattotrsate-aayrath:ertnanrequire--rne pnystc-atpresenceor-a-vetertnarianaur1ng-atl-sate~r:­
BOAH supports this change. Many markets in Indiana are unable to find a veterinarian that is 
willing to be at the market for an entire sale, just in case a certificate of veterinary inspection is 
needed. Allowing markets to have an on-call arrangement with a veterinarian is a reasonable 
approach to accommodate the reality of the veterinary services market and meet the federal 
animal disease traceability rule requirements. 
Cattle and Bison Moved to Markets 
The proposed rule seeks to clarify that cattle and bison may be moved interstate to a market 
without identification if they are moved from the farm of origin to a market and the market 
applies the identification. 9 CFR 86.4. Cattle and bison may not be moved from one market 
interstate to another market without ID. The first market must ID the animals before they are 
moved interstate to another market. BOAH supports this proposed clarification. 
The proposed rule seeks to clarify that animals may be moved interstate to a market without a 
certification of veterinary inspection (CVI) if they are moved from the farm of origin to an 
approved livestock marketing facility. 9 CFR 86.5. Cattle and bison may not be moved from a 
market interstate to another market without a CVI. The first market must provide a CVI for 
interstate movement. BOAH 
supports this proposed clarification. 
Page 11 

Calves 
The current traceability rule allows movement of sexually intact beef calves under 18 months of 
age without listing each identification individually on the CVI. This exception does not apply to 
sexually intact dairy cattle of any age. 9 CFR 86.5( c )(7). BOAH believes that the rule should be 
amended to allow movement of sexually intact dairy bull calves under 18 months of age with 
identification on a CVI that does not list each of the identification individually. 
Many dairy calves move through livestock markets in a manner similar to beef calves. Reading 
tags in the ears of dairy bull calves as they move through a market can be very difficult and time 
consuming. BOAH believes it is important that these animals be tagged with official 
identification. However once 
the animals are tagged, sufficient traceability for the dairy bull 
calves can be maintained with a CVI that does not list each animal individually. 
Backtags on Slaughter Animals 
In the first paragraph of proposed revisions to Part 86, it states that cattle or bison may be moved 
through no more than one approved livestock marketing facility and then directly to a recognized 
slaughtering establishment. The language implies that the back tag may be applied at the 
recognized slaughtering establishment. We disagree with allowing cattle or bison moving 
through a livestock marketing facility to be back tagged at the recognized slaughtering facility. 
These animals should be back tagged at the approved livestock marketing facility before moving 
to slaughter. Any cattle or bison moving through a market should be tagged before there is any 
chance of commingling, loss of origin identity, or leaving the first market. BOAH still supports 
allowing tags to be applied at the slaughter facility for movements directly from the 
farm of 
origin to a recognized slaughtering facility without any commingling. 
Application of RFID 840 Tags 
BOAH supports the limitation in the current rule prohibiting application of more than one 
official identification device or method to an animal. BOAH supports the exception provided for 
the application of 840 prefix identification to animals already officially identified with a National 
Uniform Eartagging System (NEUS) tag. 9 CFR 86.3(c)(3). But, BOAH believes this exception 
should be broadened to allow the application of 840 prefix radio frequency identification (RFID) 
tag to an animal that is already identified with a non-RFID 840 prefix tag. A non-RFID tag is 
incompatible with a system that relies on RFID tags to function, such as wand or panel readers at 
markets and many dairy management systems. With more livestock markets embracing EID 
reader technology and more dairy farms using EID for cow management, the rule should 
accommodate a market or farmer's effort to improve technology in identification and data 
capture by allowing the application of an RFID tag. 
Thank you for considering these comments.

National Pork Producers Council’s Comments Regarding Docket No. APHIS–2014–0018: Livestock Marketing Facilities     The National Pork Producers Council (NPPC) is an association of 43 state pork producer organizations that serves as the voice in Washington for the nation’s pork producers.  The U.S. pork industry represents a significant value-added activity in the agriculture economy and the overall U.S. economy.  Nationwide more than 68,000 pork producers marketed more than 117 million hogs in 2013, and those animals provided total gross receipts of more than $23.4 billion.  Overall, an estimated $22.3 billion of personal income and $39 billion of gross national product are supported by the U.S. hog industry.  After careful review and input from subject-matter experts, NPPC submits the following comments regarding USDA APHIS’s proposed rule for Livestock Marketing Facilities.  It is our understanding that the intent of this rule is to update the regulations governing Livestock Marketing Facilities and to ensure the traceability of livestock that are moved in interstate commerce to and from such facilities.  In the Proposed Revisions to Part 86, USDA is proposing to define “farm of origin” in § 86.1 as ‘‘any farm where livestock are produced, or any farm on which they are maintained for at least 4 consecutive months prior to interstate movement.” If published as written, this definition would apply to all livestock covered under the ADT rule.   This proposed definition is in conflict with 9 CFR Part 85 Pseudorabies, Section § 85.1 of which defines “farm of origin” as “A farm where the swine were born, or on which they have resided for at least 90 consecutive days immediately prior to the interstate shipment.”   NPPC suggests that the Proposed Revision to Part 86 definition of “farm of origin” should include language that specifies it only applies to cattle and bison.  Alternatively, the proposed rule could provide a definitive statement that for swine the definition of “farm of origin” in 9 CFR Part 85 Pseudorabies, Section § 85.1 takes precedence over the definition of “farm of origin” in the rule.   Based on the interpretation of the Proposed Revisions to Part 86 related to the meanings of “No More than One” found in § 86.4 and ‘‘Directly To An Approved Livestock Marketing Facility’’ found in § 86.5, any revisions to clarify the intent of the meanings 

	  	  
published in a final rule would only apply to cattle and bison, and not to swine. NPPC requests that the USDA provide a definitive statement to that effect, in order to ensure that there are no unintended consequences to the pork industry related to consistency and continuity in the identification and movement of swine to livestock marketing facilities.  NPPC and the pork industry have worked diligently and cooperatively with USDA to develop and maintain a viable animal traceability that is consistent across the industry and states.  We are concerned that without appropriate corrections in the proposed rule there will be confusion as to how the rule applies to swine.    We appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule.  We will continue to work cooperatively with federal and state animal health authorities on implementing the program standards for the Swine ID plan, so the industry has a standardized animal identification and pre-harvest traceability system for animal health, commerce and trade that is consistent across all states.

When placed back by the hip if a cow is mounted prior to the glue drying the tag is often dislodged. Tags also stay much better in the spring when animals are sheading if a curry comb is used to remove loose hair prior to application.

Re: R-CALF USA Comments in Docket No. APHIS-2014-00 18, RIN 0579-AE02:  
Livestock Marketing Facilities:  Proposed Rule 
 
Dear Sir or Madam: 
  
The Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund, United St ockgrowers of America (R-CALF USA) 
appreciates this opportunity to submit comments to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) 
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) regarding the agency’s proposed rule: 
Livestock Marketing Facilities  (Proposed Rule), published at 80 Fed. Reg. 6-13 (J an. 2, 2015) 
and 80 Fed. Reg. 16,593-594 (March 30, 2015) (reopening of comment period). 
 
Among other things, the Proposed Rule would relax requirements under the regulations in 9 CFR 
part 86, “Animal Disease Traceability” (ADT) by no longer requiring an accredited veterinarian, 
State representative, or APHIS representative be on the premises of a livestock marketing facility 
on sale days and by allowing adult cattle and bison , under certain circumstances, to be moved 
interstate without an accompanying owner-shipper statement.  
 
R-CALF USA contends that the federally mandated ADT  represents government overreach, is 
unnecessarily intrusive, and its stated objectives would be better accomplished if left to 
individual states and tribes. Therefore, any relaxa tions of the ADT’s requirements are viewed by 
R-CALF USA as favorable improvements.  
 
It is noteworthy that R-CALF USA members are concer ned with the increasing scarcity of 
accredited large animal veterinarians across the na tion, which is symptomatic of our industry’s 
fast shrinking marketing outlets. This shrinkage is the result of the ongoing vertical integration of 
the U.S. cattle industry by oligopolistic meatpacke rs and is being facilitated by the Department 
of Justice’s and USDA’s inadequate enforcement of U .S. antitrust laws and the Packers and 
Stockyards Act. Consequently, there are now far few er cattle feeders, far fewer cow/calf 
producers and far fewer cattle than there were just  a decade or so ago. Hence, there are now 
fewer economic opportunities for large animal veterinarians.

R-CALF USA Comments Regarding Livestock Marketing Facilities 
April 15, 2015 
Page 2   
 
Perhaps this is the reason for the aforementioned p roposed relaxations of the ADT requirements. 
It appears the U.S. cattle industry has already shr unk to a level where it is no longer 
economically feasible to rely on the dwindling pool of available veterinarians.  
 
R-CALF USA recommends that APHIS relax an additiona l and related requirement under the 
ADT that, like the Proposed Rule, would reduce the need to rely on large animal veterinarians to 
perform a redundant service that the ADT now requires at livestock marketing facilities. 
 
Under current regulations, a group of adult cattle offloaded at a livestock marketing facility are 
required to be run through a chute to be individual ly identified and their official identification 
numbers individually recorded by the attending vete rinarian prior to sale if they did not already 
arrive with such accompanying documentation.  It is  common for individual cattle within such a 
group of cattle to be sold to more than one buyer a t the livestock marketing facility. Presently, 
before these same cattle that had already been identified and recorded as a group prior to entering 
the sale ring can be loaded for shipment to differe nt out-of-state destinations, they must again be 
run through a chute to have their individual identi fication numbers read and recorded, and the 
resulting new documentation then accompanies the cattle to their new destinations. 
 
The requirement that individual cattle identified a nd recorded in a group must be re-recorded on 
separate documents when the group is dispersed to d ifferent out-of-state destinations is an 
unnecessary burden on livestock marketing facilitie s and their attending large animal 
veterinarians. To remedy this, R-CALF USA recommend s that each group of cattle dispersed 
interstate from the original group should be allowe d to travel accompanied by a copy of the list 
of the original group’s identification numbers. 
 
For clarity, R-CALF USA proposes this:  If cattle w ith numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 arrive at the 
livestock marketing facility, the interstate certif icate of veterinary inspection (ICVI) will list 
numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4.  If each animal is then sold  to a different out-of-state buyer, then four 
copies of the original ICVI should be made and each  individual animal would then travel 
interstate accompanied by a copy of the original ICVI that includes all four animals.   
      
This streamlining of current paperwork requirements  will not interfere with interstate disease 
tracebacks. Instead, it will help to expedite any p otential disease investigation. This is because 
animal health officials, when reviewing the documen tation accompanying a potential disease 
suspect, will have immediate access not only to whe re the individual animal originated, but also, 
which other animals had left the same farm of origin at the same time as the suspect animal.   
 
R-CALF USA encourages APHIS to adopt this recommend ed change when it promulgates its 
final rule as doing so will eliminate unnecessary b urdens on livestock marketing facilities and 
their attending large animal veterinarians and will help to expedite potential disease tracebacks. 
 
Sincerely,

Re: Docket No. FDA-2014-N-2294, Evaluation of FDA’s Multicultural Youth Tobacco Prevention Campaigns 
 
To Whom It May Concern:  
 
The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (FSPTCA) gives the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
broad regulatory authority over the manufacture, sale, and marketing of tobacco products.  One of the fundamental 
purposes of the FSPTCA is to prevent underage smoking initiation, and one of the essential purposes of the Act is to 
reduce “the number of children and adolescents who use cigarettes and smokeless tobacco and [to] prevent [] the life-
threatening health consequences associated with tobacco use.” Sec. 2(31).  In association with its regulatory efforts, FDA 
is developing and implementing a public education campaign aimed at preventing tobacco use among multicultural youth.  
This effort will help reduce the tremendous toll that tobacco takes on our nation’s health and on particular populations.   
 
The media tracking survey and the outcome evaluation study proposed by FDA are critical to FDA’s efforts to develop 
and implement an effective multicultural youth tobacco prevention campaign.  Media tracking and evaluation studies are 
important public health tools and are used regularly to assess and improve public education campaigns, and the methods 
proposed are standard ones.  The results will inform FDA efforts both during the campaign and for potential subsequent 
campaigns. 
The aims of the media tracking survey and the outcome evaluation study for which FDA seeks approval are to monitor 
awareness of and receptivity to campaign messages among the intended audience and to assess changes in tobacco-related 
knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and behavior.  It is essential that FDA have the information collected as part of these 
evaluations to ensure that the target population is being reached with effective campaign messages.  Results from these 
evaluations will allow FDA to optimize the design and delivery of messages for the target population as well as document 
the effectiveness of the campaign, including the influence of different media channels and messages on changing tobacco-
related knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and behavior. 
We urge OMB to approve FDA’s request for data collection, so that FDA is able to assure that its campaign messages will 
effectively reach the target audience and have their intended effect.

Re: Comment Letter on Proposed Housing Improvement Program Regulation Amendments 
Dear Ms. Appel: 
Please accept this letter on behalf of the South Dakota Native Homeownership Coalition 
(Coalition). Created in 2013, the Coalition is a collaborative group of key agencies with a 
mission to increase homeownership opportunities for South Dakota's Native peop le to build 
strong and healthy communities. Our stakeholders include approximately 75 representatives of 
South Dakota's tribes, federal and state agencies, the South Dakota's Governor's Office, tribally

community development financial institutions (CDFis). 
We are pleased to submit this comment letter in strong support of the proposed expansion of 
the Bureau of Indian Affairs' Housing Improvement Program (HIP} to include a down payment 
assistance program. According to a recent survey of stakeholders promoting Native 
homeownership conducted by the Coalition, 70 percent of respondents said that one of the 
biggest hurdles to homeownership in Native communities in South Dakota is the homebuyer 
readiness of clients. Some of the key ways identified by the survey respondents to prepare 
homeowners is to provide credit counseling, financial education, homebuyer education, and 
access to down payment and closing costs assistance. The Coalition is working hard to address

        Bureau of Indian Affairs 
        Docket ID:  BIA-2014-0004
Dear Elizabeth K. Appel,
On behalf of the Jamestown S’Klallam Tribe, I am pleased to respond to your request 
for comments on the proposed rule published by the Department of Interior that would 
revise current regulations at 25 CFR 256, Housing Improvement Program.  The 
Jamestown S’Klallam Tribe (the “Tribe”) is a federally recognized Tribe whose lands are 
located on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State.  Our Tribe seeks to be self -
sufficient and provide quality governmental programs and services that address the 
unique social, cultural, natural resource and economic needs of its citizens.  
Our Tribe operates a BIA Housing Improvement Program under 25 CFR 256, to assist 
needy Tribal citizens and Indian families living within our Tribal service area who have 
no other recourse for decent, safe and sanitary housing.  The proposed rule would 
update various provisions that will align the HIP Program with other Federal program 
income requirements, provide flexibility for Tribes to better address large waiting lists in 
their service areas, foster relationships with other Federal agencies on ways to leverage 
Federal housing funds, improve sustainable affordable housing on Tribal lands, 
Increase the number of Tribal citizens/ Indian families served and, increase the number 
of projects funded. We therefore appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on this 
matter.


Comments on Proposed Rule Revising 25 CFR 256
Housing Improvement Program
March 6, 2015 Page 2
General Comments: 
Category A – Repair of Existing Homes
 The proposed rule would increase the limit for Category A Funding from $2,500 
to $7,500.  We are in favor of the proposed increase to the funding limits as it 
would allow us to address more housing conditions that threaten the health 
and/or safety of our Tribal citizens/Indian families that reside in our service area.  
The current repair limits are inadequate because they do not reflect the average 
costs of housing repairs.   
Category B – Renovation Limits
 The proposed rule would increase the limit for Category B Funding from $35,000 
to $60,000 and Increase the Payback Agreement period from 5 years to 10 
years.  We are in favor of the proposed increase to the renovation limits as it 
would allow us to comply with applicable Tribal building code standards.  The 
current renovation limits are inadequate because they fail to provide adequate 
funding to improve housing conditions to a level that meets applicable building 
code standards.  We are also in favor of increasing the Payback Agreement 
period due to the fact that we will be investing almost twice as much money for 
home renovations and want to ensure that we will recoup the entire amount of 
funds invested or a portion thereof if the recipient sells the home.  The money we 
recoup could be used to address the housing needs of other HIP program 
applicants on our current waiting list.
Category D – Down Payment Assistance
 We are in favor of the new provision, Category D – Down Payment Assistance, 
which would allow us to leverage USDA Direct Loans and HUD Section 184 
Loans.  If we are able to leverage federal dollars from these other housing loan 
programs, we will be able to serve Tribal citizens/Indian families who would not 
otherwise qualify for housing because they do not have the financial resources to 
come up with a down payment.  Our working class Tribal members use their 
limited income for essential needs and cannot afford to save enough money to 
move into permanent housing.  Down payment assistance dollars could be used 
to buy down the interest rate and principle loan so that monthly mortgage 
payments are affordable for working Tribal families.",0,0

new	  category	  will	  demand	  more	  of	  the	  HIP’s	  time	  and	  resources;	  the	  program	  will	  probably	  need	  to	  allocate	  new	  staff	  members,	  new	  forms	  will	  need	  to	  be	  constructed	  and	  new	  procedures	  will	  need	  to	  be	  in	  place.	  Positioning	  down	  payment	  assistance	  under	  the	  general	  theme	  of	  “housing	  needs”	  of	  C-­‐2	  will	  prevent	  loss	  of	  time,	  energy	  and	  resources.	  	  	  	   HIP’s	  priority	  ranking	  is	  based	  on	  total	  numeric	  value	  established	  by	  points	  under	  the	  ranking	  factor.	  Within	  this	  ranking	  factor,	  each	  dependent	  receives	  three	  points,	  and	  families	  that	  encompass	  disabled	  persons	  or	  elderly	  get	  extra	  points	  added	  to	  their	  priority	  ranking.	  Of	  course	  taking	  disability	  and	  elderly	  age	  under	  consideration	  is	  justified.	  However,	  I	  do	  not	  see	  any	  priority	  points	  being	  granted	  to	  families	  with	  young	  children.	  Shouldn’t	  families	  in	  extreme	  need	  with	  children	  receive	  priority	  in	  ranking	  factors?	  Having	  homes	  or	  resources	  available	  for	  these	  families	  with	  children	  should	  be	  prioritized	  above	  all.	  It	  is	  our	  duty	  as	  society	  to	  allocate	  sufficient	  and	  necessary	  resources	  to	  these	  children	  for	  their	  protection	  and	  nourishment.	  Having	  a	  comfortable	  home	  is	  crucial	  to	  a	  child’s	  development;	  the	  lack	  of	  habitable	  homes	  will	  most	  likely	  position	  these	  children	  at	  a	  life	  long	  disadvantage.	  	  	  	   With	  this	  new	  revision,	  the	  applicant	  after	  applying	  to	  the	  program	  stays	  in	  the	  pool	  of	  prospective	  recipients	  for	  four	  years.	  This	  is	  neither	  advantageous	  to	  the	  applicant	  nor	  to	  the	  purpose	  of	  HIP.	  Having	  the	  ability	  to	  apply	  each	  year	  allows	  applicants	  to	  be	  current	  with	  the	  information	  that	  they	  provide	  regarding	  their	  financial	  status	  and	  overall	  needs.	  When	  the	  program	  finally	  reaches	  to	  an	  application	  filed	  four	  years	  prior,	  the	  applicant’s	  circumstances	  might	  be	  completely	  different	  than	  the	  time	  of	  applying.	  The	  resources	  that	  an	  applicant	  might	  need	  at	  the	  time	  the	  program	  gets	  to	  their	  application	  may	  not	  be	  reflected	  by	  the	  completed	  application	  at	  hand.	  	  Furthermore,	  having	  an	  annual	  update	  option	  will	  give	  rise	  to	  many	  technical	  issues	  that	  will	  burden	  the	  applicant’s	  chances	  of	  ever	  receiving	  the	  help.	  For	  instance,	  fleeting	  memory	  of	  the	  content	  of	  the	  original	  filing	  will	  prevent	  families	  from	  accurately	  updating	  their	  applications,	  which	  will	  have	  a	  direct	  effect	  to	  the	  increase	  of	  the	  chances	  of	  inconsistency	  in	  the	  applicant’s	  original	  filing	  and	  the	  yearly	  updates.	  This,	  in	  turn,	  will	  burden	  the	  applicant’s	  chances	  of	  receiving	  help	  in	  a	  timely	  fashion.	  	  Having	  families	  file	  every	  year	  will	  keep	  the	  application	  process	  current	  and	  consistent	  across	  the	  board	  without	  any	  extra	  dealings.	  	  	  Under	  section	  two,	  the	  subtitle	  “Other	  Changes”	  states	  that	  the	  proposed	  rule	  will	  make	  other	  revisions	  to	  update	  past	  application	  issues	  and	  better	  reflect	  current	  housing	  needs.	  	  The	  paragraph	  continues	  to	  explain	  two	  major	  proposed	  changes	  discussed	  early	  on	  under	  section	  two.	  These	  are	  HIP	  assisting	  extremely	  in	  need	  families	  (increasing

 subtitle	  of	  this	  paragraph	  is	  “Other	  Changes,”	  the	  content	  does	  not	  elaborate	  what	  these	  “other	  changes”	  may	  be,	  except	  reinstating

Re: Comments of the United South and Eastern Tribes, Inc. on the proposed rule revising 25 CFR Part 256, 
Housing Improvement Program 1076-AF22, Docket ID: BIA-2014-0004 
 
 
Dear Ms. Appel, 
 
The United South and Eastern Tribes, Inc. (USET) is pleased to provide the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA or “the 
Bureau”) with the following comments on the Proposed Rule that would revise current regulations at 25 CFR Part 
256, Housing Improvement Program (HIP). 
 
USET is a non-profit, inter-Tribal organization representing 26 federally recognized Indian Tribes from Texas 
across to Florida and up to Maine.1  USET is dedicated to enhancing the development of Tribal nations, to 
improving the capabilities of Tribal governments, and assisting USET Member Tribes in dealing effectively with 
public policy issues and in serving the broad needs of Indian people. 
 
Given the important role that the HIP plays in addressing the unmet housing needs of low-income American 
Indians, USET is pleased that the Bureau recognizes the need for updates and improvements to the program. 
However, we have concerns related to a number of the proposed changes, especially in light of the HIP’s limited 
appropriation. In addition, we note that the Proposed Rule does not address the HIP’s funding formula 
methodology, which does not currently function well for USET Tribes. 
 
Need for Additional HIP Appropriations 
Unlike many other line items in the BIA budget, appropriations for the HIP have been declining. In 2006, the HIP 
appropriation was $22.6 million, but since then, it has steadily decreased and is currently funded at $8.009 million 
for Fiscal Year (FY) 2015. The President’s FY 2016 Budget Request contains only a $12,000 increase for the 
                                                           
1 USET member Tribes include:  Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas, Aroostook Band of Micmac Indians of Maine, Catawba Indian 
Nation of South Carolina, Cayuga Nation of New York, Chitimacha Tribe of Louisiana, Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana, Eastern Band of 
Cherokee Indians of North Carolina, Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians of Maine, Jena Band of Choctaw Indians of Louisiana, 
Mashantucket Pequot Indian Tribe of Connecticut, Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe of Massachusetts, Miccosukee Tribe of Florida, 
Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, Mohegan Tribe of Connecticut, Narragansett Indian Tribe of Rhode Island, Oneida Nation of New 
York, Passamaquoddy Tribe at Indian Township of Maine, Passamaquoddy Tribe at Pleasant Point of Maine, Penobscot Indian Nation of 
Maine, Poarch Band of Creek Indians of Alabama, Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe of New York, Seminole Tribe of Florida, Seneca Nation of 
New York, Shinnecock Indian Nation of New York, Tunica-Biloxi Tribe of Louisiana, and the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah) 
of Massachusetts.   

 
 
 
 
 
program. Yet, in its report on the HIP for 2014, the Bureau acknowledges that it was only able to serve 99 out of 
7,032 eligible applicants nationwide. In order to responsibly implement many changes in the proposed rule, USET 
urges the Bureau and this Administration to request a much more substantial appropriation for the HIP.  
 
Categories of Assistance Funding Limit Increases 
In concept, USET is highly in favor of the proposed increases to funding limitations for housing needs Categories 
A and B. We agree that the current monetary limits on these categories do not accurately reflect the average 
costs of repair and renovation. This is particularly true in BIA’s Eastern Region, where the average cost of living, 
including costs related to housing renovation and construction, is higher than that of many other Regions. 
However, increasing the funding limits for these categories in the absence of significant additional appropriations 
is unwise. Unless the Administration and Congress work together to fund the HIP at meaningful level, increasing 
funding limits may serve to limit the number of approved HIP applications.  
 
Category D 
Similarly, USET supports the addition of Category D, which would provide for down payment assistance. This new 
category will further assist in serving the goals of the HIP—to provide adequate housing for eligible low-income 
American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). In its proposed form, however, Category D is lacking spending 
caps and other safeguards that current HIP assistance categories possess. For instance, the proposed category 
has no cap on the amount of funding that may be awarded. Without a cap, the limited appropriation that the HIP 
receives may be distributed to a much smaller number of recipients. In addition, while each of the other categories 
of assistance provide for payback agreements, should the recipient be foreclosed upon or sell the property, the 
new Category D does not. Finally, eligibility for Category D carries with it a 30 point value in Ranking Factor 
(factor #6: Applicants with an Approved Financing Package). This could lead to an approval bias toward Category 
D applications while needs related to the other three categories continue to go unmet. 
 
Without some modest limitations, Category D has the potential to consume a large portion of the HIP 
appropriation, as well as facilitate the misuse of funds. In order to preserve the integrity of the HIP, USET urges 
the Bureau to incorporate award limits and payback agreements into the requirements for Category D. Award 
limits should reflect housing costs within a given Region, but balance this assistance with the need for funding for 
the other categories. Any funds that are received via payback agreements should be returned to the Tribe, Tribally 
Designated Housing Entity (TDHE), or Tribal organization directly operating the HIP Program or the BIA, so that 
they can serve other eligible applicants. The Bureau should further consider reducing the 30 point value for an 
approved financing application. 
 
Payback Agreements and Self-Governance 
The current procedures for payback agreements are not consistent with the principles of Tribal self-governance 
under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA) and the Native American Housing 
Assistance and Self-Determination Act (NAHASDA). In the event of home sale or foreclosure, HIP funds should 
be returned to the Tribe, TDHE, or Tribal organization directly operating the HIP Program or the BIA, rather than 
solely the BIA. This change would then allow for the HIP funding to stay directly within the community where it 
was originally invested, consistent with the intent of ISDEAA, NAHASDA, and the self-governance movement. 
Otherwise, a return of funding to the BIA could result in unnecessary delay, red-tape, and/or return to the Treasury 
and out of the realm of meeting Tribal housing needs. 
 
Ranking Factor Rule Changes 
Of the changes to the rules associated with the four current Ranking Factors, USET is strongly supportive of the 
increase in income guidelines. With the high cost of living in the Eastern Region comes an increase in income that 
currently prevents many low income AI/ANs from accessing the HIP. While the Federal Poverty Level (FPL)",0,0
2014-30692,BIA-2014-0004-0011,"March 6, 2015 <br/><br/>VIA ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION<br/>Bureau of Indian Affairs <br/>Attn:<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Elizabeth Appel, Director, Office of Regulatory Affairs &amp; Collaborative Action<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Subject:<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Comments on Proposed Amendments to Housing Improvement Program, Docket Nos. BIA-2014-0004<br/><br/>My name is Christina Sturdevant and I am a first year law student in California.  <br/><br/>First, the proposed amendment to the Housing Improvement Program that will increase the income guidelines fits squarely within the Bureau of Indian Affairs mission.  The Bureau of Indian Affairs mission is to enhance the quality of life, promote economic opportunity, and to carry out the responsibility to protect and improve the trust assets of American Indians, Indian tribes, and Alaska Natives. If the income guidelines are increased from 125 percent to 150 percent of the federal poverty level, more American Indian and Alaska Native families will be eligible for the housing improvement grants.  Individuals living at 150 percent of the federal poverty level, while slightly more advantaged than those living at 125 percent of the poverty level, still require adequate housing conditions.  The increase of 25 percent will allow families who do not have financial resources to repair or renovate their existing homes.<br/><br/>Second, the Act should be amended to increase the monetary limit of funding granted to Category A and Category B recipients.  Category A and Category B recipients currently receive a maximum of $2,500 to repair or renovate their homes.  As stated in the proposal, this amount is inadequate to create material changes to the existing homes of impoverished families.  Of course, any funding creates a dent, but $2,500 is unlikely to make any lasting improvements.  For example, re-carpeting a small apartment costs at least $1,000.  Surely, the Bureau of Indian Affairs mission to enhance the quality of life of American Indians, Indian tribes, and Alaska Natives is only minimally carried out by such a small repair.  While an apartment may be re-carpeted, there might be termite damage (several thousands of dollars to repair), water damage, and any host of costly repairs that need fixing.  A grant of merely $2,500 simply is not enough to truly enhance the quality of life of these families.  Further, these amendments will advance the requirements of 25 U.S.C.  13, which state that, the Bureau of Indian affairs use money appropriated to them by Congress to assist in the relief of distress and conservation of health of Indians throughout the United States.  This proposed amendment would improve the health of impoverished Native American families by improving basic needs.  For example, water damage can lead to mold, bed bugs can lead to a host of health issues and unfit housing conditions contribute to a host of mental illnesses.  Therefore, the act should be amended to reflect the proposal of an increase from $2,500 to $7,500.<br/><br/>Finally, the proposal to amend the payback period for Category B grant recipients from five years to ten years should not be implemented because it is coercive and places an undue burden on recipients of the grants. Payback agreements require recipients to pay back the entire amount of funding received or a portion thereof if the recipient sell a home repaired or renovated with grant money within a certain period of time. Currently, that period of time is set at five years.  The proposal is to amend that period to ten years.  This increase will detrimentally affect the life opportunities of grant recipients because they will be constrained by the requirement that they stay in their home for at least ten years.  This will greatly impair the abilities of families who may in the future decide to seek job opportunities far from home.  Of course, part of the Bureau of Indian Affairs mission is to increase the economic opportunities of Native American, and Alaska Native families.  The requirement that families who took advantage of the opportunity to improve their homes, and better their lives, will limit their economic opportunities long term.  For example, it is conceivable that five years from repairing ones home, a grant recipient who has been unable to find employment learns about greater job opportunities in another locality or state.  This individual will be constrained by the requirement not to sell their home because they will have to pay back the amount of funding they received five years prior.  While the individual will have a home that is hospitable, he or she will not also have the resources that come with a recurring paycheck.  Therefore, the proposed amendment to the Category B payback period is an impediment to future economic opportunities of grant recipients and should not be implemented.<br/><br/>Respectfully submitted,<br/><br/>Christina Sturdevant <br/> <br/><br/>",2015-03-12T04:00:00Z,2015-03-05T20:10:54Z,,,,,,,,,,,,false,0,,,0,0

Re: Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Proposed Rule for the Housing Improvement Program 
(HIP) 
Dear Ms. Appel, 
On behalf of the Maniilaq Association, headquartered in Kotzebue, Alaska, we submit 
comments on the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Proposed Rule for the Housing Improvement 
Program (HIP). The Maniilaq Association, is a regional tribal organization representing 12 
federally recognized tribes in northwest Alaska, including: the Native Village of Ambler, Native 
Village of Buckland, Native Village of Deering, Native Village ofKiana, Native Village of 
Kivalina, Native Village of Kobuk, Native Village ofKotzebue, Native Village ofNoatak, 
Noorvik Native Community, Native Village of Point Hope, Native Village of Selawik, and 
Native Village of Shungnak. 
The Maniilaq Association supports the value of the HIP program, but also challenges the 
Department of Interior (DOl) and the BIA to work with Congress to fund the program at a 
meaningful level that can actually meet existing needs in Indian Country and for Alaska Natives. 
We support the BIA's overall intent in the Proposed Rule to provide greater flexibility in the 
implementation of the HIP, more effective priorities for funding, higher limits for allowable 
costs (including freight costs for materials, which is a significant issue in Alaska), and longer 
active period for pending applications, among other developments. As noted in the comments 
below, however, we also have recommendations for further improvements for the Proposed 
Rule. 
• §256.7 ofthe Proposed Rule and Increase in Amounts: 
• The increase in amounts for Category A funding for interim improvement assistance up 
to $7500 (from the previous $2500) is an appropriate and positive change, particularly 
with the explicit allowance of freight costs. We recommend, though, that the BIA revisit 
this amount within 2-3 years, rather than the lengthy time that lapsed prior to the 
Proposed Rule, to make certain this amount continues to be sufficient, particularly in 
Alaska.

• The increase in amounts for Category B funding for renovation assistance up to 
$60,000 (from the previous $35,000) is an appropriate and positive change, particularly 
with the explicit allowance of freight costs. We recommend, though, that the BIA revisit 
this amount within 2-3 years, rather than the lengthy time that lapsed prior to the 
Proposed Rule, to make certain this amount continues to be sufficient, particularly in 
Alaska. 
• The inclusion of allowable freight costs in Alaska to Category C funding is a welcome 
change. 
• The addition of a new category of down payment assistance as Category D is another 
welcome addition to the HIP program, though we recommend that the definition of 
""standard housing condition"" in§ 256.2(1) should state that construction conforms to 
codes ""and/or to appropriate building standards for the region where no such codes 
exist."" We note that in rural Alaska, and·the Maniilaq region in particular, there are 
circumstances where building codes do not always match up, or keep pace with best 
practices in building standards. Adding the above underlined language would 
acknowledge this regional difference. 
• §256.9-Category B Assistance. 
We recommend that §256.9(d)(2) be revised to be consistent with the Indian Self­
Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA), 
1 
and practice of self-governance by 
many tribes and tribal organizations operating the HIP program. That revision would read as 
follows: 
""At the time of settlement of the sale of the house, you will repay the tribe, or tribal 
organization directly operating the HIP Program or the BIA the full cost of all 
renovations made under this part."" 
This change would then allow for the HIP funding, if it is returned in the 1 0 years following 
completion of repairs and renovation, to stay directly within the community where it was 
originally invested, consistent with the intent of ISDEAA and the self-governance movement. 
Otherwise, a return of funding to the BIA could result in unnecessary delay, red-tape, and/or 
return to the Treasury and out of the realm of meeting tribal housing needs. 
• §256.1 O-Cate gory C Assistance. 
We recommend that §256.10(b)(2) be revised to be consistent with the ISDEAA, and 
practice of self-governance by many tribes, and tribal organizations operating the HIP program.

Re: Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Proposed Rule for the Housing Improvement Program 
(HIP) 
Dear Ms. Appel: 
These comments, on the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Proposed Rule for the Housing 
Improvement Program (HIP), are submitted by the Spokane Indian Housing Authority, located 
on the Spokane Reservation in Eastern Washington State. 
First, and probably most important, the Spokane Indian Housing Authority joins with 
other tribes/TDHEs/tribal organizations to urge BIA and the Administration to seek a significant 
increase in appropriations to fund HIP and to increase the focus in the BIA on this program. HIP 
rightly targets a part of the population that is in dire need of such support. HIP has had a 
significant impact in the lives of Indian people, but over the years the amount of funding in real 
dollars has dropped substantially. The result has been to limit the effectiveness of the program. 
As you know, there have been a great deal of news coverage lately about the importance of 
""housing first"" in addressing a variety of social ills - unemployment, crime, drug and alcohol 
abuse-that we see in Indian Country. HIP has the potential to ensure that some of the lowest 
income Indian families can maintain their homes and avoid homelessness or overcrowding, but 
to reach that potential it must be funded at a sufficient level. 
We join with other tribes/TDHEs/tribal organizations in supporting the value of the HIP 
program, the Department of Interior (DOl) and the BIA to work with Congress to fund the 
program at a meaningful level that can actually meet existing needs in Indian Country. The 
Spokane Indian Housing Authority supports the BIA's overall intent in the Proposed Rule to 
provide greater flexibility in the implementation of the HIP, more effective priorities for funding, 
higher limits for allowable costs, and longer active period for pending applications, among other 
developments. As noted in the comments below, however, the Spokane Indian Housing 
Authority also has recommendations for further improvements for the Proposed Rule.

!!AGENCY: US Department of Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) 
ACTION: Proposed rule. 
DATE POSTED: January 2, 2015 
CLOSE DATE: March 6, 2015 
SUBJECT: Housing Improvement Program  
! In accordance to the Federal requirements, the proposed rule increases the number of 
Indians’ families that could accede to housing funds for repairing (A), renovating (B) or 
replacing (C) existing housing and for providing (D) new housing. Specifically, it is an 
amendment to the Housing Improvement Program (HIP).This safety-net program is based on a 
priority ranking that identifies individuals and families most in need of housing assistance, 
among the eligible members of federally recognized Indian tribes.  
 Actually, I am an International law student of the Nova Southeastern University just for a 
semester. The majority of my legal interests and of successful exams is on international field; 
therefore my final Thesis in Romatre University will concern exactly the international matter. 
Here, in the United States, I am part of a minority group, the italians.  
In general, even when I was in my native land, I have always struggled for the recognition and 
the development of the minority groups. Mostly of my interest is focused on people with 
disabilities; specifically, I participated to several open meetings of the ANIEP, an italian non 
profit association, and of my territorial church. For these reasons I am strongly interested on the 
rule proposed by BIA, which defends and promotes a minority group’s right.  

 In particular, the proposed rule would add, to the four existing categories of housing 
needs (A,B,C and D), a new one for the down-payment assistance. Furthermore, it would also 
increase the limits for the categories A and B.  
Analyzing the actual distribution of the funds, it is based on ranking factors; these factors are the 
Annual Household income, the age requirement, the disabilities and the family size. The 
proposing rule would add new factors for homelessness, overcrowding, and dilapidated housing.  
The Bureau of Indian Affair would also lengthen the payback period of Category B (from five to 
ten years) and the time for consideration of an application (from one to four years).  
It would better satisfy requirements of the  American with Disabilities Act (ADA) by increasing 
the square-footage limits of the house. 
The changes would also allow the applicant to provide proof of homesite even by lease, rather 
than requiring ownership.  
Finally, it would allow for HIP assistance to families with a very low income, rather than just 
families with extremely  low income.  
 Throughout the development of the proposed rule, the Bureau of Indian Affairs had held 
several listing sessions with representatives of federally recognized Indian tribes. Indian tribes 
indicated that the actual program does not satisfy the indian members’ needs. They expressly 
declared that structure of the system does not allow them to make progress on the waiting lists of 
member with housing needs. Therefore, the proposed rule is the result of several listenings, 
consultation and dialogue between the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian Tribes. 
The preservation and the development of the member of Indian tribes are very important in the 
United States. Indeed the indian tribes, even if represent a minority part of the population, are",0,0

The down payment assistance funds will help Native American families qualify for homeownership financing.  Since this is a new category and expands the allowable HIP Programs housing assistance funds and services there should be clarification that these funds may be used for: down payment assistance, closing costs, education in financial literacy and homebuyer education and counseling. <br/>o<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Income Eligibility for Category D In order to insure that the HIP down payment assistance is available to families who can afford mortgage financing, we recommend that income eligibility be defined for Category D by using the definition provided by the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act (NAHASDA) regulations.  This would allow eligibility by participants with annual income that is 80 percent of the area median income or United States median income, whichever is higher.  (12 CFR 1000.10)  <br/><br/>o<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Previous Assistance While we recognize the need to serve clients who have not previously received assistance through the HIP program, we recommend that the restriction from being eligible for the HIP down payment program not apply to recipients of Category B rehabilitation funds if the funds were received prior to a certain time, e.g. more than 25 years ago (proposed Section 256.6 (g)).<br/><br/>o<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Set-Aside In order to promote the use of the down payment assistance program, we recommend that 10 percent of each Regions HIP allocation be set-aside for Category D.  If the funds are not expended by the end of the fiscal year, they could be reprogrammed for other HIP categories.  It is important to document need for Category D so future appropriation requests can be increased to meet the need to assist Native American families with down payment assistance. <br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Ranking Factors I support adding the new ranking factors of homelessness, overcrowding, and dilapidated housing will help identify the housing needs of the poorest of the poor.  As the need for safe, sanitary and affordable housing increases it is very important to document the need (funded and unfunded) for all categories so future appropriation requests can be increased to provide adequate allocations to Tribes, especially those who have the highest poverty conditions, address their housing shortage. <br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Advisory Committee for Handbook  I recommend that  the Bureau to create an Advisory Committee made up of representatives from Tribes, TDHEs, current HIP Directors, Native CDFIs, and other lenders to provide input during the development of the HIP Handbook that will provide guidance for HIP implementation. <br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Participation in Federal Government-Sponsored Housing The restriction against acquiring your present housing through participation in a Federal government-sponsored housing program (proposed Section 256.6 (h)) should deleted because it is unclear and could possibly unnecessarily limit participation.  For example, would an applicant be eligible if he or she obtained their home through a Mutual Help or rent-to-own program, HUD Section 184, or RD Section 502?  We dont think participation in any of these programs should restrict participation in HIP, especially Category D. <br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the Housing Improvement Programs proposed program regulation amendments.  It is encouraging to see proposed changes that will have a positive impact on the eligible Native American families.

which started in 1979, and I met  many people who remembered their reservation lives.
My suggestion is called ""The Modular Utility Housing Insert Plan"".... I have sent this suggestion to the
Navajo Housing program but not sure if they ever tried it but here are the basics:
1.  Build a Utility Box  that can attached to an existing house that has no utility options or
     it can be inserted into a new house being built.
2.  It would be a wood and metal framed ""module"" that would include basic plumbing, electricity and
     heating options that could be built by a contractor or at a factory.
3. Plumbing would include pipes that would bring water into the house and distribute them to sinks,
     water faucets and toilets if needed.  
4. Electrical wiring option would bring in wiring for lights, electrical outlets and fans and heaters.
5.  On the Navajo reservation because there is very little electrical power lines coming to homes, this
     module could be powered by solar panels that store electrical power in batteries and then it could
     come into the house.  The solar panels would be installed either on the roof or on solar frames outside.
  6. One design feature would be that on one end of the 8 to 10 foot long utility module there could be 
     a doorway so that people could check and repair problems inside the module if needed.
 7. The Modular Rectangle should be 8 to 10 ft long and at least 6 ft wide so that things like small water
      heaters could be placed inside....but if appliances are not needed inside then the Utility Box would 
      only have to be 4 ft wide but it would still be ""crowded with pipes and wiring.
  
 After visiting Indian housing in South Dakota and New Mexico and Arizona, I became convinced that a plan
that would help many people with a design that could be created in large numbers and then passed on to 
Indian housing to improve their homes and their lives. 
Since this is being sent via email, I can't include a design ""picture"" but again if people believe that a Utility
Box would help improve Native American housing, then a professional might set up a formal design.
If more information or more suggestions would be helpful, please reply to this email
Thank you for trying to improve Indian housing around the country.

proposed rule changes for HIP and let me know that the comment period was ending today. 
On Wednesday, I received the following comments from the Jon Warner, Housing Director for the Confederated

and maybe email; so I am going to submit them both way.  Thanks 
I also, received the following comment verbally from Brian Thomas, Tribal Councilman for Duck Valley
Shoshone­Paiute Tribe, he requested that I send it in for him:
He believes we should have an additional Factor for Veterans should be added 20pts, that Disability remain the
proposed flat point but be 20pts not 10pts, and that Age should have a maximum of 20pts not 15pts.
I hope this is an acceptable means of submittal.  Thanks for all your help.

Thanks for the excellent training yesterday in Elko.
Melissa and I have been talking about the changes being considered and would like to
share our thoughts.
We have concerns about the change in the age requirement and the disability requirement.
As far as the age goes elderly persons between 55 and 62 and above 77 get either no
points or no additional points. I believe that is an excessive reduction in point consideration.
We would recommend that the age stay at 55 to start point consideration with a maximum of
20 points not 15. Any one above 75 would get 20 points which does not overly consider the
elderly.

The disabled should get more consideration. 10 points are not enough.
We have no comments regarding the income and the points for children is a good change
allowing for more points for larger families.

Dear BOEM Officials: 
Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the Environmental Assessment (EA) for the 
Virginia Offshore Wind Technology Project (VOWTAP). While I support Dominion's two test 
turbine project, such development must be done in a way that ensures robust protections 
for marine mammals and sea turtles, in particular for the North American right whale 
(NARW).  
In order to support a Finding of No Significant Issues (FONSI), BOEM must amend the 
final EA to include the following measures: 
 prohibit pile-driving during the NARWs peak migratory season from Nov. 1 to April 
30 
 during that time, place a uniform 10-knot speed limit restriction on all vessels of any 
length affiliated with the VOWTAP project 
 provide for a minimum of four qualified observers located at the pile driving site 
 require the developer to use the best commercially available technology to reduce 
noise associated with construction of the VOWTAP project 
I applaud BOEM's efforts to bring clean renewable offshore wind power online as soon as 
possible. The crisis we face with climate change demands it. We in Virginia are especially 
vulnerable to its impacts with our Hampton Roads area being second only to New Orleans 
in its vulnerability to sea level rise. 
From the VOWTAP project, critical information and ""lessons learned"" can be gleaned that 
can facilitate Dominion's timely build-out of its adjacent commercial lease area. We urge 
BOEM to work closely with Dominion and other project developers to facilitate build-out of 
the commercial lease area as soon as practicable, getting a substantial amount of wind 
power in operation no later than 2020.  
Finally, offshore wind development can provide a valuable compliance tool in meeting 
Virginia's obligations under the EPA's Clean Power Plan - assuming it comes on line in a 
timely manner.  
Thank you again for this opportunity to comment. 
Sincerely,

RE:  Virginia Offshore Wind Technology Advancement Project on the Atlantic Outer  
         Continental Shelf Offshore Virginia Environmental Assessment 
 
Dear Ms. Morin,  
 
We are writing this letter as marine science professionals from the Virginia Aquarium & Marine 
Science Center Foundation (VAQF), Research & Conservation Division. To be clear, the following 
comments are the opinions of the signers of this letter, and do not reflect the organizational opinion of 
VAQF.   
The mission of the Virginia Aquarium is to inspire conservation of the marine environment 
through education, research and sustainable practices. The VAQF Research & Conservation Division is 
responsible for directing many of the organization’s efforts in these areas and is dedicated to 
conservation through marine animal stranding response, research, rehabilitation and education. VAQF 
currently coordinates sea turtle and marine mammal stranding response for the state of Virginia. From 
2001 to 2010, our organization responded to a total of 950 marine mammal and over 1500 sea turtle 
strandings. As part of our stranding response efforts, we have collected over 20 years of data related to 
marine species presence, health, and anthropogenic risk in Virginia.  In addition to stranding response, 
VAQF has received federal, state, and private funding for a variety of research projects in Chesapeake 
Bay and coastal mid-Atlantic waters. Over the past decade, VAQF has conducted research on sea turtles 


VAQF Comments Page 2 
 
and marine mammals utilizing boat-based and aerial surveys, photo identification and biopsy sampling, 
satellite telemetry tagging, and health assessment studies. In addition, VAQF has researched fishery by-
catch and gear modifications, developed education and outreach programs, and conducted a vessel 
behavior characterization study.   
The intent of this letter is to provide comments related to the Bureau of Ocean Energy 
Management (BOEM) publication of the “Virginia Offshore Wind Technology Advancement Project on 
the Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf Offshore Virginia Environmental Assessment (OCS EIS/EA BOEM 
2014-1000)” (hereafter referred to as the EA). The VAQF is supportive of the development of offshore 
wind energy in Virginia waters and we are enthusiastic about being involved in the Wind Energy Area 
(WEA) National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process.  
We are focusing our comments on the effects of the proposed actions to marine mammals and 
sea turtles in the waters off the coast of Virginia. We agree with the EA’s conclusion that, “The impacts 
to marine mammals and sea turtles as a result of construction, operation and decommissioning activities 
related to the Proposed Action are anticipated to be negligible to moderate” (EA Section 3.2.6).  We 
would like to address the need to coordinate all parts of the WEA development process and wish to 
contribute additional information about marine mammals and sea turtles related to the Proposed Action 
in the following three comments: 
 
Comment 1:   
We recommend that BOEM implement an inter-organization, ecosystem-based adaptive 
management plan to guide the regulatory process associated with offshore wind energy development 
in the mid-Atlantic region, and suggest that a long-term species monitoring program be the 
cornerstone of this plan. Development of the proposed Wind Energy Areas (WEAs) would be an 
unprecedented marine construction project - the first we know of in open ocean migratory corridors for 
marine and avian species. To insure that all aspects (economic, social and cultural, and environmental) 
are equally represented through the planning processes we recommend that BOEM, in consultation with 
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and other 
stake-holder organizations, develop an inter-organization, ecosystem-based adaptive management plan. 
The management plan should be used to guide the process of research activities, SAP approval, and 
construction and operational plan (COP) approval. Specifically, we recommend that the management 
plan incorporate a comprehensive survey program designed to address current biological data gaps and",0,0

This represents an invaluable opportunity to deploy ship-board profiling wind Lidar units to collect data for resource assessment and model validation.  These data sets would be invaluable in reducing uncertainty for AEP estimates and improving numerical weather prediction models for day-ahead production forecasts and for vessel operation (O&amp;M) planning and safety.  Recent research at UMBC has confirmed the feasibility of ship-board Lidar deployment for weather model validation. See attached white paper for a discussion of the methodology, experiment and results.<br/><br/>2. As a general comment, I would stress that the risks and impacts to marine mammals from geophysical surveys for OSW development are much lower than O&amp;G exploration and development since O&amp;G requires much deeper bottom penetration and much higher sound pressure levels.   I strongly support development of OSW and oppose O&amp;G development for this and many other reasons.  <br/><br/>3.   Section 3.1.1.6 - No Action Plan.

Executive Summary  
 
Wind resource evaluation can benefit from new insights into the fundamental physical mechanisms 
responsible for variability across the rotor span, the boundary layer, and the entire region, including the 
Maryland Wind Energy Area (WEA).  This report describes how data from a variety of in-situ and 
remote sensing instruments including Lidar are being used to characterize processes in the atmosphere 
and ocean and improve their representation in simulation models.  This report also documents the 
development of a new Lidar Motion Compensation Algorithm (MCA) for vessels underway.  
 
Floating Lidar technology has the potential to replace met towers in many cases, once accepted by the 
industry.  However, current systems are integrated into floating buoys and incorporate proprietary 
MCAs, which are all designed for motion of an anchored buoy.  By developing and validating an 
algorithm that can be applied to a Lidar unit on a moving vessel,  the UMBC MCA is opening the range 
of deployment possibilities to an entirely new set of platforms.   Many types of vessels that could serve 
as Lidar platforms traverse in or near the MD WEA on a daily basis.   During WEA survey and 
construction operations,  vessels could be continuously collecting wind profile data for use in 
configuring and nudging forecast models, and fine-tuning production estimates.   The cost of lidar units 
will come down significantly as technology improves and economies of scale are realized.   Eventually, 
commercial vessels may be equipped with wind Lidar profilers and the data used in forecasting models,  
just as is often done with marine weather radar data from ships.  The preliminary validation indicates 
that the UMBC MCA has nearly identical error and uncertainty characteristics to the internal, 
proprietary Leosphere MCA used by the WindCube.  The next stage of the analysis is to use the 
Forward Model Algorithm to test the MCA under simulated wind fields and vessel speeds and motions.  
This is currently underway and an update will be provided in the next quarterly report.    
 
In the absence of strong synoptic forcing, smaller scale regional mechanisms in the Mid-Atlantic are 
revealed.  These have the potential to generate locally strong winds that may coincide with high grid 
loads [1,2 ].  Satellite sea surface temperature data often shows cool water upwelling along the coast, 
creating a low-level local baroclinic zone and changing the low level thermal stability.  There has been 
recent research on the impact of low level thermal stability on winds in the rotor layer [3,4].  The overall 
impact of such events on the wind resource offshore depends on how often they occur, which remains to 
be determined. Their predictability depends on whether the larger synoptic scale situation leads to 
conditions that make such small scale events more likely, and if any synoptic scale precursor conditions 
can be identified.   A detailed investigation of low level jet formation and its precursors is ongoing.  
 In addition,  the occurrence of negative shear conditions across the rotor layer may be more frequent 
than expected, as shown by the preliminary analysis of data from NASA-DAWN1 Lidar, and  the NOAA 
marine met stations designated CHLV2 and NDBC 44010.  This has significant implications for rotor 
design, production estimates, and power forecasting.  Further investigation of this phenomenon is 
ongoing.

2014-30767,BOEM-2014-0077-0034,"I believe that the EA was done very thoroughly and it covered many aspects that needed to be covered. The EA mentioned that the construction, maintenance, a decommission of the wind mills will have no significant impact on air quality standards especially with comparison to the air quality that already exists in the area. It is important to point out that if successful, this project could lead to the cutting down of NOx, CO2, and PM 2.5 emissions in the area due to coal powered electricity. However, I do not know the standards and data that was used to determine that the air quality in the project areas would not be affected by the projects emissions. My concern is based on what data was used to determine that the air quality in the project areas would not be affected by the project. If the data was based on a yearly basis there average would be skewed due to the fact the summer months, especially at Virginia Beach, there is an increased amount of Tourism that leads to an increase of CO2 emissions as well as other harmful substances into the air. So why does this matter? The locals are already used to their air quality decreasing during the summer months because of the tourists but how would this project affect the other 8-9 months out of the year? Will it get better or will get worse?

2014-30767,BOEM-2014-0077-0023,I live in Virginia Beach and sail in the bay and the ocean. I fish on the Atlantic shoreline and visit the beach at least 12 times a year.  I fully endorse this project in the location proposed for the preferred alternative. My daughter further recommends a protected fish area around the turbines.  I suspect the area immediately around the turbine might be a security area. This effort is needed to further use available wind resources.  I look forward to underwater turbines harvesting energy from the Gulf Stream.  ,2015-01-23T05:00:00Z,2015-01-03T14:52:32Z,,Daniel,Duquette,NA,,,,,,,,false,0,,,0,0

Growing up in Southern New Jersey, Atlantic Electric took a giant leap by installing 5 wind turbines on Atlantic City&#39;s skyline and they&#39;ve been going strong for many years.  When my husband was stationed over-seas in England eight years ago, wind farms were vast spread across the country-side and shore lines....not to mention throughout other areas of Europe.

This EA describes reasonably good details on many issues that need to be covered.  However there appear to be some gaps that I wish to bring to your attention that should be addressed:<br/><br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The EA report says on page 82 the applicant has proposed that pile driving will occur in May.  Then on page 109 the EA says pile driving will occur May through July.  Which is correct?  <br/><br/>2.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Please be more specific about the aviation safety lights (page 67) that will be used.  These need to be the most bird-friendly aviation safety lights known, which should be based on studies that have been supported by US Fish and Wildlife Service.  My understanding is that white strobe lights are the least likely to attract birds during inclement weather (which is when this issue is most critical).  This should be explicitly stated in the EA, and required in the turbine procurement specifications.<br/><br/>3.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>It is important that Dominion Virginia Power carry out post-construction monitoring during operation of the project to evaluate actual impacts from the wind turbines on birds, as stated on page 67. Post-construction monitoring is important to verify whether a problem really exists, to improve impact predictions from future scaling-up of wind power development in the area, and to guide any adaptive management that might be warranted. The EA should specify how the findings from post-construction monitoring would be used to improve operation of the wind turbine facility, as needed.  BOEM should require Dominion Virginia Power to make all the post-construction monitoring data readily available to the public.<br/><br/>4.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>There appear to be some contradictions between the EAs description of the onshore impact area from all onshore construction activities (Section 3.2.4.2, page 71) versus the photo shown at:  https://www.dom.com/corporate/what-we-do/electricity/generation/wind/virginia-offshore-wind-technology-advancement-project.  Specifically, in this photo (section titled Onshore Interconnection), the cable right-of-way appears to be cutting through a forested area and a wetland. Meanwhile, the EA (Section 3.2.7.2, page 122) states that no clearing of native vegetation is expected during construction along the route of the onshore cables. Which version is correct?<br/><br/>5.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Please describe in more detail the vegetation and the land cover of the onshore impact area.  <br/><br/>6.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>On page 105 the EA says:  compliance with the NOAA speed restrictions within the MidAtlantic SMAs of 10 knots for vessels 19.8 m (65 ft) or greater during the period of November 1 through April 30 would further reduce risks of vessels colliding with endangered NARWs. While this is positive, the EA should explain further how ship speeds would be monitored and enforced. For example, would each ship have a black box that automatically records the ships speed and transmits this information to regulators and the public? Would the black box also set off an automatic, loud alarm bell such that all crew members could hear when the ship is speeding, and influence how this is operated such that it will stay within required guidelines?  What will be the penalties (fines, suspension, dismissal, or criminal prosecution) for violations?  How will this compliance information be recorded and reported?<br/><br/>7.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>How would compliance with the important procedures specified in Appendix A of Section 7.1 (Paragraph 12) be monitored, enforced, and reported? This is particularly relevant to the cessation of pile driving when marine mammals or sea turtles are nearby.  <br/><br/>8.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>This EA describes only this demonstration project rather than what would likely occur if this demonstration project shows that Virginia Off shore Wind Energy Development is a viable low-carbon electricity source for Virginia.  The two demonstration turbines will be decommissioned after their useful life which potentially could be as long as 50 years from now.  What will happen once research results are shown?  What will this project lead to for Virginia?<br/><br/>Thank you very much for the opportunity to comment and provide input to this project.

RE: Draft regulatory guide (DG), DG-5027, ""General Use of Locks in Protection and Control of
Facilities and Special Nuclear Materials, Classified Matter, and Safeguards Information.""
Dear Ms. Bladey,
The Organization of Agreement States (OAS) Executive Board (Board) has reviewed the above
document and respectfully submits the following comments for consideration by the NRC.
1. Although there is good general information about locks in this guidance document, all of the
specific instruction is for Parts 50 and 73 licensees or licensees with safeguards information.
It's unclear what Increased Controls licensees are supposed to take away from this document.
The Board recommends adding specific examples for Increased Controls licensees that are not
Part 50 or 73 licensees or licensees with safeguards information.
2. Additionally, the Board recommends the following language be added to the document: ""This
document is intended as additional voluntary guidance on the security requirements found in
Part 37. Licensees need not apply this guidance in order to comply with Part 37.""
We appreciate the chance to comment on this subject, and stand ready to answer any questions you may
have.

Re: Draft Regulatory Guide DG-5027
Dear Ms. Blady:
The Virginia Radioactive Materials Program (VRMP) has reviewed this draft guidance on ""General
Use of Locks"" and provides the following comments for the NRC's review:
1. The VRPM recommends verbiage be included in Section B, ""Discussion"" that licensees under the
Part 37 regulations are currently in-line with the security requirements and that this guidance is to
help licensees understand the complexity of locks that can be used.
2. The VRMP does not understand the following statement made on page 18: ""However, voluntarily
using the subject matter in the guidance may change a licensee's plan such that the NRC review
may be required under the provisions of 10 CFR 37.43...."". The security plan required under 10
CFR 37.43 should always be part of a license inspection and not just subject to review based upon
the licensee using this guidance document on locking devices. The VRMP recommends removing
this statement from the guidance.
3. The VRMP recommends that discussion regarding Part 37 licensees be separated from licensees in
Part 50, 70 and 73. The VRMP contends that Part 37 licensees may believe they are required to
follow this guidance and/or amend their license to commit to this guidance even though that is not
required in the licensing requirements for Part 37.
The VRMP thanks you for your consideration of our comments and if you have any questions please
contact Mike Welling at 804-864-8168 or mike.welling(&vdh.virginia.gov.

(Jan. 2, 2015) (Docket ID NRC-2014-0276)
Project Number: 689
Dear Ms. Bladey:
On behalf of the nuclear energy industry, the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI)' appreciates the opportunity to
provide comments on the Draft Regulatory Guide DG-5027; ""General Use of Locks in Protection and Control of
Facilities and Special Nuclear Materials, Classified Matter, and Safeguards Information,"" 80 FR 53 (Jan. 2,
2015) (Docket ID NRC-2014-0276).
The purpose of this Draft Regulatory Guide (DG-5027) is to describe to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC) staff, the methods and procedures acceptable for the selection, use, and control of locking
devices in the protection of areas, facilities, and specific types of information. Our overarching comment is
that there appears to be no risk-informed graded approach employed with regard to the level or type of
material being protected and that the guidance may not present a clear understanding of applicability.
NEI is the organization responsible for establishing unified nuclear industry policy on matters affecting the nuclear energy industry, including
the regulatory aspects of generic operational and technical issues. NEI's members include all utilities licensed to operate commercial nuclear
power plants in the United States, nuclear plant designers, major architect/engineering firms, fuel fabrication facilities, materials licensees,
and other organizations and individuals involved in the nuclear energy industry.

1 3 B1.1 In addition, the guide contains updated references and relevant regulations fwe=}
where identified.
Reason: typo
2 5 1 Replace: Sentences two, three and four with:
""If the combination of a lock is changed by an intruder, that person would have access,
but an authorized user would not.""
Reason: Clarity.
3 5 2 The combinations of some key-change locks can be changed directly when the lock is in
the open position, while others must have the existing combination reentered f=tae
..d__' when the access is in the open position to permit the combination
change.
Reason: It isn't always to a different index; this detail isn't helpful to most readers
4 5 4 First sentence: replace ""(Ref. 11)"" with ""(Ref. 12)""
Reason: Ref. 12 is correct
5 5 4 Replace second and third sentences with:
""To be approved by the General Services Administration (GSA), security
containers and security vault doors and doors for facilities approved for open
storage of classified information must be secured with a lock approved under
Federal Specification FF-L-2740. The only exception is for field safes, safes
specifically designed and built for protection of classified material under field
conditions. These may use a lock meeting Underwriters Laboratories Inc. (UL)
Standard 768, ""Combination Locks,"" (Ref. 13), Group 1 or 1 R. Currently, field
safes are manufactured with locks meeting Federal Specification FF-L-2937.""
Reason: Original had errors and was awkwardly written; Ref. 13 is correct.
6 5 5 Replace second, third, and fourth sentences with:
""Six locks have been approved under Federal Specification FF-L-2740: Mas-
Hamilton Group models X-07 and X-08, Kaba Mas models X-09 and X-10, and
Sargent and Greenleaf models 2740 and 2740B. All six models are
electromechanical locks; the X-07, X-08, X-09, and X-10 are generator-powered,
and the 2740 and 2740B are battery-powered. While all six models are
approved, only the X-10 and 2740B are currently being produced.""
Reason: Original had errors and was not current.

Dear Ms. Bladey: co
Thank you for the opportunity to review the generic Environmental Impact Statement for
License Renewal of Nuclear Plants Supplement 54 regarding Byron Station, Units 1 and 2
(Docket NRC-2013-0178). With respect to the Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement
(SEIS), we have the following comments.
The SEIS includes an assessment of potential effects upon federally listed species that may occur
in the project area. The assessment concludes that, because no suitable habitat is present,
relicensing the Byron Nuclear Plant will have no effect on Myotis septentrionalis (Northern
long-eared bat), Myotis sodalis (Indiana bat), Lespedeza leptostachya (prairie bush clover),
Platanthera leucophaea (Eastern prairie fringed orchid), or Daleafoliosa (leafy prairie clover).
We concur with your determination.
This precludes the need for further action on this project as required under Section 7 of the
Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. If project plans change or portions of the
proposed project were not evaluated, it is our recommendation that the changes be submitted for
our review. These comments are provided in accordance with the Endangered Species Act of
1973 (87 Stat. 884, as amended; 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq).
This letter provides comments under the authority of and in accordance with provisions of the
Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (48 Stat. 401, as amended; 16 U.S.C. 661 et seq.); and the
Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. Questions concerning this letter should be
directed to Mr. Jon Duyvejonck (telephone 309.757-5800, ext. 207).
Sincerely,

that 
VOWTAP 
is 
subject 
to 
Federal 
Nonattainment 
New

(NSR), 
which 
it 
is 
not. 
VOWTAP 
would 
be 
subject 
to 
major 
NSR 
permitting 
(i.e
., 
PSD

only 
if there 
is 
potential 
to 
emit 
over 
2SO 
tons 
per 
year 
(TPV) 
of 
a single 
criteria 
pollutant. 
Because 
the 
potential 
to 
emit 
is 
less 
than 
2SO 
TPY 
but 
greater 
than 
100 
TPY, 
VOWTAP 
would 
be 
considered 
a State 
Major

subject 
to 
the 
same 
regulations 
as 
minor 
NSR 
permits, 
but 
administered 
by 
the 
Virginia 
Department 
of 
Environmental 
Quality 
(DEQ). 
Additionally, 
because 
DEQ 
has 
been 
authorized 
to 
implement 
and 
enforce 
the 
Outer 
Continental 
Shelf 
air 
regulations, 
VOWTAP 
would 
be 
subject 
to 
permitting 
through 
DEQ 
and 
not 
the 
USEPA. 
Dominion 
has 
applied 
for 
an 
air

anticipates 
receipt 
in

Dominion 
concluded 
further

determine 
whether 
these 
anomalies 
are 
potential 
archaeological 
resources, 
since 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
make 
this 
determination 
based 
on 
the 
geophysical 
signature 
alone. 
In 
addition, 
a qualified 
marine 
archaeologist 
recommended 
a 
buffer 
area 
for 
each 
anomaly 
of 
either 
114.8 
or 
164ft 
{3S

as 
appropriate. 
BOEM 
investigated 
the 
anomalies 
with 
divers

concluded 
that 
one 
is 
a 
large 
concrete 
anchor 
of 
no 
significance.

Re: Draft Plant-Specific Supplement 54 to the Generic Environmental Impact
Statement for the License Renewal of Byron Station, Units I and 2, Ogle County,
Illinois - NI-REG-1437 - CEQ #20140383
Dear Ms. Bladey:
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has reviewed the Draft Supplemental Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS) for the above-mentioned project prepared by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC). Our comments are provided pursuant to the National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA), the Council on Environmental Quality's NEPA Ioplementin Re, glations (40 Ct R
1500-1508), and Section 309 of the Clean Air Act.
Byron is a two-unit nuclear power plant located in Ogle County, Illinois. It began operation in
February 1985 (Unit 1) and January 1987 (Unit 2). The site is located on approximately 1,782
acres, including the main site area and a right-of-way to the Rock River for the circulating water
makeup intake and blowdown discharge pipelines. The nuclear reactor for each unit is a
Westinghouse pressurized-water reactor producing 2,370 megawatts electric (MWe).
Byron is owned and operated by Exelon Generation Company, LLC (the applicant). The
applicant applied to NRC for an extension to its operating license, extending operation for an
additional 20-year period. Based on information provided by the applicant, NRC's preferred
alternative is to grant the 20-year extension.
The NRC developed a Generic EIS to streamline the license renewal process based on the
premise that environmental impacts of most nuclear power plant license renewals are similar.
NRC develops facility-specific Supplemental EIS documents as the facilities apply for license
renewal. EPA acknowledges that mitigation measures that are un-related to nuclear safety and
security cannot be included in the NRC license. This includes, but is not limited to, diesel
emissions reduction measures. However, because we find these measures to be value-added, we
continue to recomnend them to the applicant for any construction activities and include them in
our comment letters. We encourage the applicant to incorporate mitigation measures into the
project, wherever possible.

Based on our review of the Draft Supplemental EIS, we have rated the document and project as
EC-1, Environmental Concerns - Adequate Information. EPA has identified additional
potential mitigation measures and some areas in need of clarification. We have enclosed our
ratings definitions and our detailed comments.
EPA commends NRC and the applicant on improved transparency in this document when
contrasted with EISs for some other nuclear power plants that we have reviewed in recent years.
We particularly note the improved compliance with plain language writing requirements. EPA
found this document more easily understood, particularly for those without a technical, nuclear-
related background. Reviewers also required fewer cross-references throughout the document;
references often included specific locations within documents (rather than simply citing a full
document). EPA encourages continued improvement by NRC on this matter.
EPA also commends NRC for specifying that certain methodologies used for risk determination
meet all Federal regulation1 , particularly ones that are related, but covered independently by both
EPA and NRC.
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this document. If you have any questions or wish
to discuss any aspect of this document, please contact Elizabeth Poole of my staff at 312-353-
2087 or poole.elizabeth@epa.gov.

2014-30756,NRC-2013-0178-0011,"DOCKET NUMBER NRC-2013-0178 Byron Nuclear Power Plant Relicensing<br/><br/>I oppose the license renewal for the Byron Plant because it is a not environmentally sound and is a serious threat to human health and safety. <br/><br/>I am a 72 year old male retiree, residing ca. 20 miles south-southwest of the facility. I have family members--including children--living 5-10 miles from the plant and I fear for their health and safety. Research reveals increased cancer risk for those living within 10 miles of nuclear power plants and other studies show that nuclear workers have a greater risk of cancer than the survivors of Hiroshima/Nagasaki bombings in WWII. Nuclear power plants emit radiation daily and more serious releases occur during refueling.<br/><br/>There is no safe level of radiation. The health consequences of exposure to continued low levels are  worse than one high level exposure. <br/><br/>Exelon&#39;s competence in operating Byron is questionable, as indicated in &quot;Toxic Management Erodes Safety at &#39;World&#39;s Safest&#39; Nuclear Plant&quot; by Dreux Richard (The Japan Times, March 11, 2013). The allegations in this article have not been adequately or publicly addressed by Exelon or the NRC in my estimation, and the suggestion by the NRC Public Relations staff  that I dig through reams of documents to see if the situation was adequately dealt with leaves me cold. An associate of mine was a career employee at Byron who took early retirement out of frustration and disgust, stating, &quot;Nuclear power is fine--if its done right.&quot;  (And also indicates that most of the above mentioned ariticle is true). <br/><br/>I recommend tthat the NRC institute policies and procedures to assure that Exelon and other plant operators maintain management practices that do not intimidate employees who are trying to ensure safe operation of nuclear power plants, and to inform the public of violations of said policies and remediation of said violations.  Toxic management does not assure safety for the health of the environment, the public, and staff.<br/><br/>The alternatives to the renewal of the Byron license are clear and viable: Wind, solar and other renewable energy sources are now environmentally and economically sound. It is time to let this Nuclear Neanderthal technology die a hopefully swift death.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>",2015-03-20T00:00:00Z,2015-02-20T00:00:00Z,2015-02-23T00:00:00Z,Anonymous,Anonymous,,,,,,,,,false,0,,,0,2
2014-30756,NRC-2013-0178-0007,"On behalf of UCS, I submitted FOIA/PA-2015-0082 seeking Final Safety Analysis Report records received after October 1, 2001, by the NRC from all nuclear plant owners, including the Byron licensee. By letter dated January 7, 2015, the NRC administratively closed my request. By email dated December 30, 2014, the NRC staff notified me that the estimated page count for the requested records was 448,000 just from Region IV. That email estimated approximately 4,000 pages per FSAR per reactor with multiple updates per reactor since October 1, 2001 -- accounting for the hundreds of thousands of pages per region. <br/><br/>By withholding this vast quantity of FSAR material from the public, the NRC is significantly impairing our ability to review and comment on licensing request such as this one for Byron. The FSARs describe the safety-related structures, systems, and components at the plant and further describe their role in preventing or mitigating design basis transients and accidents. <br/><br/>NRC regulation 10 CFR 50.59 requires licensees to screen proposed modifications and changes to plant operating procedures to see whether the proposed changes might reduce safety margins approved by the NRC in a significant way. If so, the changes cannot be made until after the NRC reviews and formally approves them. The 10 CFR 50.59 screenings and evaluations rely heavily on information in the FSARs. The FSARs are also extensively used by NRC&#39;s reviewers when evaluating licensee requests for licensing actions.<br/><br/>As stated above, by withholding hundreds of thousands of pages of FSARs from the public, the NRC is significantly impairing our ability to participating in licensing proceedings in a meaningful away. The licensees and the NRC staff rely heavily on the FSAR information while preparing and reviewing requests for licensing actions, but the NRC&#39;s withholding prevents the public from reviewing this information. <br/><br/>The hundreds of thousands of pages of vital information being withheld by the NRC staff is being done so improperly. Entire FSARs, such as the recent updates for Beaver Valley Unit 2 and Watts Bar Unit 2, were made publicly available by the NRC in their entirety. This demonstrates that FSARs do not contain classified, safeguards, or sensitive information that must be withheld from public disclosure. <br/><br/>The NRC should not approve this licensing request at Byron until after the agency makes all the FSAR information for Byron publicly available and gives the public sufficient time to review this information. Failing to do so transforms this licensing process into a mockery of justice. ",2015-02-04T00:00:00Z,2015-01-21T00:00:00Z,2015-01-21T00:00:00Z,David,Lochbaum,,,,,,,,,false,0,,,0,2

BYRON BULLET POINTS .-H
Feb 2, 20:15 _ kC/r)
1.) FACTS:
! Byron has been slated by Exeton fior possible closure due to unprofitability.
* One way utilities use to regain profitability is to cut costs; at a plant like
Byron, this could mean cutting staff, cutting O&M, or both
* Exelon's comments on unprofitability may indicate that it has already engaged
in actions that have degraded the safety levels at the reactor site.
SCOMMENT/CONCERN:
o NRC needs to insure that Exelon cuts neither staff nor O&M spending,
and that both are kept at levels to insure the safety of the public., the
workers and the plant.
o NRC needs to publicly guarantee that any workers expressing safety
concerns publicly do not experience any form of retribution, as has
previously occurred (refer to Dreux Richards concerns)
o Can a utility publicly stating it may have to close a reactor site be
serious about continuing the costly relicensing process, and vice versa?
And be serious about meeting its requirements in full?
2.) FACTS:
* Byron has been slated by l1'xelon for possible closure due to unprofitability.
o Worker layoffs and other economic. disruption are guaranteed when Exelon
makes the decision to close Byron, for whatever reason it chooses
o COMMENTS/CONCERN:
i. As part of the relicensing process, NRC needs to publicly affirm that
sufficient funds are currently available in the decommissioning fund to
meet NRC requirements for decommissioning, as outlined in current
NRC decommissioning calculation lbrmulas.
it. A ""just transition fund."" needs to be established immediately, as a
condition for community acceptance of relicensing, that financially
prepares the workers and community for a loss of incomes and
economic benefits. This needs to be negotiated among community
leaders, workers and their union. leadership, and Exelon management;
it can also be a part of negotiations with the Legislature, Exelon, and
workers' unions.

To Whom It May Concern,
We would like to take a few minutes to comment on how the Exelon Nuclear Facility in Byron,
Illinois is a testament of how a company is good for the community and how it helps in its
endeavor to be a good example and a good caregiver to the community and Mother Earth.
Byron has shown how it helps the community and surrounding area with its willingness to give
back. They have been there to help with financial support for thle rehabilitation of any animal
and migratory bird that has been hurt or injured. They have helped with the rehabilitation and
transportation costs for wildlife and to make sure they have a safe place to be released back into
the wild.
Foxelon is also been very good to the community in its willingness to go the extra mile to do
education programs and outreach program to schools, community centers, etc. They show how
Exelon wants to be a good caregiver to Mother Earth and its neighbors. They have asked
""1100"" Haven to help them with environmental programs in tile community and have helped us
in our endeavor to present The Environment and how you can help give back. We teach and talk
about companies that show they care about the wildlife and how everyone can help the
environment.
On another note, Exelon has shown that it has been very responsible in its care and upkeep of
their facility in Byron. They are very good for the community and its surounding area.
They provide needed jobs to many people. These include all the personal at the plant, the
security guards and of course, the tradesmen like the electricians, plumbers, pipefitters, welders
and all the other trades to keep the facilities in top condition. They are very good about their
scheduled outages to keep everything in the best shape. They police themselves very well.
Exelon is also good for the community in the revenue they provide for the government agencies
that receive funding from their operation of the nuclear plant.

This will help better describe the severity of the cracking present in each HPMS reporting section ( 0.1 mile in lenght), therefore resulting in a more accurate assessment of the actual pavement condition in each HPMS reproting section.  For example, a HPMS section may have less than 5% of cracking on the surface but the severity of that cracking may be high based on prevaling standards, while another HPMS section may have 20% cracking with low severity. For me the section with &lt; 5% cracking may be consider poor based on the severity of its cracking instead of good based on the current criteria included in the proposed regulation.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>",2015-03-12T04:00:00Z,2015-03-12T04:00:00Z,,Luis,Rodriguez,,,,,,,,,false,0,,,0,0
2014-30085,FHWA-2013-0053-0070,"Some comments on Pavement Condition Measures<br/><br/>International Roughness Index (IRI) has long been part of the HPMS but as a measure of roughness, it should not be the sole pavement performance measure.<br/><br/>In or around 1995 a pavement was rated as poor if the IRI was greater than 220 but this was for the non-interstate routes whereas the threshold for the interstate routes was set at 170.  Reference past issues of Highway Statistics to find this metric.  Now the proposal is to set the threshold at 170 outside of all urban areas that have less than one million population and then at 220 inside the urban areas that have more than one million population for the non-interstate NHS.  A pavement with an IRI between 170 and 220 may be rough but it is not necessarily in need of rehabilitation or maintenance.  A PCI rating may be a better indicator of that since it has to do with condition and not only roughness.<br/><br/>According to the statewide Local Streets and Roads needs assessment done in California, about 80-90% of the pavement ratings are done in PCI (Pavement Condition Index) or similar, which is pretty much all the cities and counties that reported to the needs assessment survey. <br/><br/>But how many agencies measure IRI?  It is principally the state DOT that has to assume this responsibility.  <br/><br/>The burden and time and cost of measuring the IRI on all of the NHS and the samples of minor arterial and collector streets seems to be a greater challenge than collecting PCI from the MPOs.  PCI is almost always easier to obtain and less costly than IRI and PCI is standardized under the specification ASTM D 6433 (2007).<br/><br/>As for the HPMS connection, PSR is reported in the HPMS and PCI can be converted to PSR.  This is not to say that it isnt as easy to create one more data item and report the PCI.<br/><br/>In 2014 dollars, California has to spend 3-4 million annually to collect the IRI.  The faulting, rutting and cracking will be about another 1-2 million annually.  Nationally, this could run $40-50 million every year to comply with the reporting for the IRI, faulting, rutting and cracking along with the person-hours of contract administration since most of this work is done under contract.<br/><br/>It may be worthwhile to reexamine the business case for using PCI as a pavement performance measure.<br/>",2015-02-10T05:00:00Z,2015-02-09T05:00:00Z,,Brian,Domsic,,,Sacramento,CA,United States,94274-0001,,,false,0,,,0,0
2014-30085,FHWA-2013-0053-0078,"My recommendation is to incorporate a clause into this rule that promotes the support of small businesses across the nation, within each state and county, so as to encourage the economic growth within each region that will already be given a boost if this rule is passed due to the increase in demand for civil contractors as well as the new positions the DOT will be required to hire in support of the inspection and construction accounting associated with each new project.  I believe it is imperative that this new rule doesnt end up catering to the Oligopoly or even Monopoly that the exists with the big general contractors such as Las Vegas Asphalt Paving in Las Vegas, NV who currently consumes the majority of asphalt paving in Clark County.  Furthermore, some level of marketing for the availability of this type of work to current small business general contractors should be included for this feat.  <br/>I fully support this new proposed rule as it takes a major step in the right direction to correcting the overload of renovations and new roads and bridges that this growing nation requires.  I support the initiative to enable the DOT as the enforcer and authority to issue fines to those regions who are in violation of this new rule.  I also support the given target time periods for renovations as reasonable.  The 2-4 year period is more than sufficient, as long as the language is explicit in that reasonable time be allotted for weather delays or other uncontrollable circumstances so that no fines be levied for such delays.  I do feel that the cost benefits might be a bit understated.  Certainly places that are experiencing high traffic volumes that are given funding for the widening of the roads or where new bridges provide access quicker to areas will benefit the local economies as well the social mentality from lessening their daily commute.  Not to mention the superordinate goal of keeping cars on the road less to bring down CO2 emissions.  <br/><br/>",2015-03-30T04:00:00Z,2015-03-27T18:52:21Z,,Nicholas,Cazares,,,Las Vegas,NV,United States,89139,,,false,0,,,0,0

General Comments 
 
 Page 338, 3rd column – We support the acknowledgement by FHWA that local transportation 
priorities can and will be taken into consideration during the process of establishing targets. 
Furthermore, we support the understanding that State DOTs and MPOs may elect to establish 
targets that represent a decline in pavement or bridge system conditions. 
 
Subpart A: General Information 
 
490.101 Definitions 
 The distinction between the definitions of “metric” and “measure” is appreciated. 
 
490.105 Establishment of Performance Targets 
 We support the language that encourages State DOTs and MPOs to coordinate target setting 
with neighboring states and MPOs “to the extent practicable”. FHWA is encouraged to offer 
guidance and share best practices on this type of coordination among neighboring states and 
MPOs. 
 If State DOTs choose to establish condition targets for urbanized areas, the rule should 
encourage coordination with the corresponding MPO(s). 
 We support the proposed language in 490.105(f)(4) that allows MPOs two options in setting 
targets. FHWA policies and guidance need to clearly state that MPOs committing to quantifiable 
targets for their metropolitan planning area are NOT required to re-establish targets when the 
corresponding State DOT adjusts its target as allowed under 490.105(e)(6) and 490.107(b)(2). 
490.107 Reporting on Performance Targets 
 We support the proposal that MPOs document the manner in which they report their 
established targets within the Metropolitan Planning Agreement, and that established targets 
are reported to State DOTs. 
 We support using the Metropolitan Transportation Plan to report information on baseline 
condition/performance and the progress towards the achievement of MPO targets. 
490.109 Assessing Significant Progress towards Achieving the Performance Targets for the NHPP 
 We support the definition of “significant” progress towards achievement of condition targets. 
490.111 Incorporation by Reference 
 We support the incorporation by reference of: the HPMS Field Manual to codify the data 
requirements for measures; 10 AASHTO standards to codify the method and/or device used to 
collect data for the metrics; and the “Recording and Coding Guide for the Structure Inventory 

 
 
and Appraisal of the Nation’s Bridges” which contains all of the NBI items listed in Subpart D. 
The use of widely accepted standards and calculation methods will facilitate the establishment 
of targets and monitoring of progress towards their achievement. 
 
Subpart C: NHPP Measures for Assessing Pavement Condition 
 
490.309 Data Requirements 
 We support the statement that “Beginning in 2018, State DOTs would be required to collect 
data on the full extent of non-Interstate NHS to calculate the 4 metrics.” Federal performance 
management requirements should not impose additional data collection responsibilities upon 
local governments.",0,0

Dear Mr. Shea, 
February 20, 2015 
We are writing to request that the comment period for the proposed rule regarding Approved 
Livestock Marketing Facilities (Docket No. APHIS-2014-0018) be extended for at least 60 days. 
First, we appreciate USDA's recognition that the existing regulation is antiquated and the work 
put in to modernizing the requirements. We are also grateful for the engagement and 
communication USDA has had with stakeholders in this process. 
The approved 
livestock facility regulation and agreement play a major role in the way approved 
livestock marketing facility owners run their operations. This proposal makes substantive changes 
to the agreement as well procedural changes to how the process works. USDA also makes a shift 
to include some requirements that apply to all livestock marketing facilities regardless of entering 
into an agreement to become a USDA-approved facility. In addition, the proposed rule makes 
some clarifications to the Animal Disease Traceability rule. 
Due to the numerous components of the proposed rule an~ the significanc~ the~e shifts could 
have on livestock businesses, we want to be sure we fully engage. the livestock market owners, 
cattle producers, and others who may be affected by this rule. While this process is well under 
way, an extension would help ensure affected entities are fully aware of the different components 
of the rule and take advantage of the opportunity to comment. 
Your consideration of and agreement to this extension request would be greatly appreciated. If 
you have any questions or would like to discuss this request further, please contact Chelsea Good 
at Livestock Marketing Association at cgood@lmaweb.com or 816-305-9540. 
Sincerely, 
...

To	Whom	It	May	Concern:	
	
1. The	Memphis	Urban	Area	MPO	supports	the	transition	to	numerical	based	
scoring	to	assess	the	quality	of	NHS	roads	and	bridges	as	well	as	interstate	
pavement	condition.	Using	numerical	scores	removes	some	of	the	ambiguity	
of	more	qualitative	scores	such	as	Good,	Fair,	or	Poor.		
2. The	Memphis	MPO	also	supports	aligning	our	scoring	system	with	the	
Tennessee	Department	of	Transportation	(TDOT)	and	the	Mississippi	
Department	of	Transportation	(MDOT)	scoring	system	because,	although	a	
local	scoring	system	would	possibly	reflect	local	conditions	in	a	more	refined	
matter,	the	extra	step	of	defining	these	measures	at	the	MPO	level	and	
integrating	them	in	with	TDOT	and	MDOT	could	be	an	unnecessary	and	
burdensome	step	for	the	MPO.		
3. To	streamline	the	process	and	create	a	reporting	system	that	is	more	unified	
and	comprehensive,	we	support	standardizing	the	tracking	of	infrastructure	
conditions	with	TDOT	and	MDOT	to	reach	national	performance	goals,	
increase	transparency	and	reduce	some	of	the	difficulties	of	trying	to	
integrate	an	MPO	based	tracking	and	monitoring	system.	
4. We	request	further	clarification	on	the	frequency	and	method	of	reporting	
data	to	the	State	DOTs	and,	in	turn,	FHWA.	Does	FHWA	have	a	conceived	
process	in	which	the	data	reporting	will	occur?	
5. 	In	conclusion,	we	support	adhering	to	established	targets	set	by	the	State	
DOT’s	and	FHWA	for	purposes	of	standardization	and	ease	of	empirical

Dear Sir/Madam: 
KIRK T. STEUDLE 
DIRECTOR 
Michigan Department of Transportation Comments on Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
Docket FHW A-20 13-0053, National Performance Management Measures: Assessing Pavement 
Condition for the National Highway Performance Program and Bridge Condition for the 
National Highway Performance Program; Proposed Rule 
The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) appreciates the opportunity to provide 
comments on the proposed pavement and bridge performance measures and associated 
requirements. 
MDOT participated in the development of comments submitted by the American Association of 
State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and concurs with the content of their 
submission. In addition, MDOT appreciates consideration of the following comments: 
Proposed Pavement Performance Measure -The AASHTO comments provide sound 
rationale for delaying implementation of several of the proposed metrics. MDOT' s experience in 
developing and working with our own pavement performance measure may further aid the 
Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) in understanding the concerns raised by AASHTO. 
In the 1990s, MDOT invested in the development of a performance measure called Remaining 
Service Life (RSL) to guide investment decisions. RSL is a forecasted estimate of time until 
reconstruction or major rehabilitation treatment will most likely be more cost-effective than 
preventive maintenance. RSL is forecasted, in part, using initial service life benefit assumptions 
(per project type) based upon distress growth curves. Distress is tracked by MDOT's ""Distress 
Index"" derived from crack surveying data obtained via manual review of collected pavement 
imagery. While there are data challenges with estimating RSL, the concept and basic definition 
of RSL serve our department well in tracking and forecasting investment/benefit effects on our 
pavement network's overall health. 
As RSL was being developed, MDOT also invested in the development of a network level 
pavement condition modeling tool that uses RSL and forecasts future pavement conditions of the 
state owned system based on investment strategies. This analytical tool, called the Road Qualify 
LH-LAN-0 (01111)

Forecasting System (RQFS), plays an important role in the development of network level repair 
strategies used for program development and reporting. It also offers the ability to forecast 
""what if' pavement condition scenarios based on alternative funding and/or mix of fix levels. 
MDOT has over 20 years of experience in utilizing RSL as the centerpiece of our pavement 
performance management efforts. Over that span of time, we have developed knowledge on a 
range of factors that impact pavement conditions, and we are comfortable predicting how our 
level of investment and mix of fixes will impact future system conditions in terms of RSL. The 
ability to predict future pavement conditions based on current investments is critical to the 
success of a performance management framework. 
MDOT is concerned that states will be required to develop targets for the proposed performance 
measures and make investment decisions long before we have an understanding of how those 
investment decisions will impact future pavement conditions. We have spent time surveying 
resources and analytical tools that might be useful in helping to understand how investment 
decisions will shape future pavement conditions under the proposed performance measures. 
However, we are not confident a complete set of tools cwTently exist to support the proposed 
measures. We appreciate FHWA's commitment to developing such tools (as noted on page 334 
of the Federal Register Notice), and believe that having these tools, along with a more thorough 
understanding of the pavement performance measures, are an important prerequisite to moving 
ahead under this framework. 
The ·framework MDOT uses for pavement performance management (RSLIRQFS/asset 
management) took years to develop, test, and refine, and we continue to invest in improvements 
to that framework. Learning from the experiences of states like Michigan will, no doubt, reduce 
the amount of time it will take to fully implement a framework similar to that which is proposed 
in this rule. However, MDOT believes it will take years, not mere months as proposed in the 
rule, to fully develop an effective framework for performance management. 
Therefore, in order to ensure that states are properly positioned for success within the proposed 
performance management framework, MDOT recommends that consideration be given to 
alternative implementation schedules and processes. Unless and until a complete set of tools are 
available (including a solid set of baseline data) that can help states accelerate their 
understanding of how funding scenarios and fix types affect the proposed measures, we should 
not be required to use them to make investment decisions. One such alternative would be to 
allow states to utilize their own pavement 
performance measure for the next several years, while 
the measures proposed in this rule are refined to the point where they become mature enough that 
states can be confident using them as the basis for investment decisions.",0,0

Dear 
Acting 
Administrator 
Nadeau: 
The 
City 
ofNapa 
appreciates 
the 
opportunity 
to 
comment 
on 
Federal 
Highway 
Administration 
(FHWA)'s 
proposed 
rule 
on 
National 
Performance 
Management 
Measures 
for 
Pavement 
and 
Bridge 
Conditions. 
In 
California, 
local 
jurisdictions 
own 
and 
maintain 
most 
of 
the 
collector 
and 
arterial 
roadways 
as 
well 
as 
the 
residential 
streets. 
The 
state 
is 
generally 
responsible 
for 
the 
higher 
speed 
facilities, 
namely 
highways 
and 
interstates. 
Less 
than 
5% 
of 
the 
total 
road 
system 
in 
California 
is 
part 
of 
the 
National 
Highway 
System 
(NHS) 
under 
MAP-21, 
and 
ofthe 
portion 
that 
is 
considered 
NHS, 
approximately 
36% 
of 
those 
facilities 
are 
designated 
arterials 
and 
are 
under 
local 
control 
and 
maintenance. The 
Metropolitan 
Transportation 
Commission 
(MTC) 
is 
the 
designated 
Metropolitan 
Planning 
Organization 
for 
the 
San 
Francisco 
Bay 
Area 
which 
has 
been 
practicing 
pavement 
management 
in 
its 
region 
for 
over 
30 
years. 
MTC 
requires 
that 
local 
jurisdictions 
in 
the 
Bay 
Area 
have 
a 
certified 
pavement 
management 
program 
in 
place 
in

to 
be 
eligible 
to 
receive 
regionally

All 
of

have 
adopted 
the 
same 
pavement

is 
based 
upon 
the

The 
City 
ofNapa 
is 
located 
within 
the 
MTC 
region 
and 
has 
approximately 
465 
lane 
miles 
of 
paved 
streets that 
it 
is 
responsible 
for 
the 
repair 
and 
maintenance 
of. 
Approximately 
290 
of 
those 
lane 
miles 
are 
local 
streets 
and 
175 
are 
collector 
and 
arterial 
roadways. 
Like 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
jurisdictions 
in 
the 
MTC 
region, 
the 
City 
ofNapa 
currently 
collects 
information 
by 
performing 
annual 
street 
surveys 
to 
determine 
the 
PCI 
for 
its 
roadways. 
Pavement 
Condition: 
There 
are 
important 
local 
implications 
of 
the 
federally 
proposed 
rule 
on 
National 
Performance 
Management 
Measures 
for 
Pavement 
and 
Bridge 
Conditions. 
We 
respect 
FHWA's 
struggles 
and 
careful 
consideration 
in 
proposing 
a single 
performance 
measurement 
for 
pavement, 
however 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
International 
Roughness 
Index 
(IRI) 
is 
a measure that 
results 
in 
inaccurate 
performance 
assessments 
for 
local 
facilities. 
We 
are 
concerned 
that 
the 
benefit 
of 
having 
a 
single 
nationwide 
standard 
comes 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
local 
jurisdictions. 
IRI 
is 
not 
an 
appropriate 
measure 
for 
local 
roadways 
and 
the 
introduction 
of 
an 
additional 
layer 
of 
performance 
measurement 
on 
top 
oflocal 
jurisdictions' 
existing 
methods 
injects 
unnecessary 
expense 
and 
creates 
confusion 
that 
can 
only 
hinder 
asset 
management 
efforts 
at 
the 
local 
level. 
With 
federal 
transportation 
legislation 
over 
the 
years, 
there 
has 
been 
a devolution 
of 
responsibilities, 
resulting 
in 
an 
accepted 
premise 
that 
one 
size 
doesn't 
fit 
all 
and 
that 
decisions 
are 
best 
made 
at 
the 
local 
level 
with 
broad 
guidance 
from 
the 
Federal 
government. 
It 
is 
in 
this 
context 
that 
we 
submit 
the 
following 
comments: 
1) 
IRI 
is 
an 
appropriate 
measure 
for 
high-speed 
highway 
and freeway 
facilities, 
but 
it is 
not 
an 
appropriate 
measure 
for 
lower 
speed 
rural 
highway and arterial 
roadways. 
Arterial 
roadways 
make 
up 
a sizeable 
share 
(approximately 
36%) 
of 
the 
National 
Highway 
System. 
IRI 
measures 
the 
functional 
property 
of 
a pavement, 
whereas 
the 
measure 
we 
are 
currently 
using, 
PCI, 
is 
primarily 
a structural 
condition 
measurement. 
The 
measurement 
of 
functionality, 
or 
ride 
quality, 
is 
important 
for 
facilities 
with 
high 
speed 
travel; 
however, 
not 
very 
significant 
for 
the 
lower 
speeds 
that 
typically 
occur 
on 
arterial 
roadways. 
Additionally, 
the 
pattern 
of 
roadway 
deterioration 
and 
wear 
and 
tear 
is 
different 
for 
highway 
and 
arterials. 
On 
arterials, 
cracking 
can 
be 
derived 
from 
factors 
such 
as 
utility 
trenches 
and 
may 
be 
very 
different 
from 
the 
cracking 
that 
occurs 
on 
highways. 
2) 
An 
outcome 
of 
applying 
IRI 
to 
local 
roads 
is 
that 
it 
would 
encourage 
a shift 
away 
from 
preventive 
preservation 
treatments 
to 
costlier 
rehabilitation 
and 
reconstruction 
projects. 
IRI 
is

Summary: 
This rulemaking would create national performance management measures and standards to be 
used by the States to meet the national transportation goals identified in section 1203 of MAP-
21. This rulemaking would also establish the process to be used by States to set performance 
targets that reflect their performance measures. The FHWA anticipates issuing up to three 
rulemakings in this area. This rulemaking, number two, will cover the bridges and pavement.
There are some general comments concerning the overall application of the proposed rules
that I would like to make to assist the reviewers of the comments that will be received during 
this public process.  
As a retired FHWA employee, and as a person who worked in local government for 13 years, 
and as the holder of a Master of Public Administration degree, I have experience and 
knowledge of the Federal Program from those perspectives.  As a licensed Professional 
Engineer with private sector experience, and as an industry representative, I have both 
practiced and taught pavements and pavement management for many years.
Comment #1 – No State and MPO Flexibility
The FHWA Executive Director has stated on numerous occasions that the MAP-21 legislation is 
“transformational.”  I agree with Mr. Paniati’s assessment.  The long-standing Federal-aid 
Highway Program provided financial resources to the various States and MPOs to support new 
highway construction, rehabilitation, reconstruction, maintenance, and preservation of our 
public highway assets.  For the first time, Congress has enacted legislation that not only 
provides resources to the States and MPOs – essentially “free money” for transportation 
programs (but with some strings attached) - but will also now require the states and MPOs to 
report back to FHWA and Congress about the results of their use of that money.  That simple 
change, to require the reporting of results, is a major – indeed “transformational” – change 
from the original program.  The old FAHP was hardly an “unfunded Federal mandate.”  When 
applying for and accepting Federal-aid dollars, the States and MPOs agreed to meet all of the 
conditions that Congress has determined are necessary.  The States and MPOs had broad 
discretion and flexibility as to which projects would use Federal dollars, and how the money 
would actually be spent.   MAP-21 now requires States and MPOs to actually demonstrate that 
their acceptance and use of Federal funds is having an impact on the conditions and 
performance of the highway network for which the States and MPOs have accepted 
responsibility.  Congress was wise to make this change.  

The flexibilities that the States and MPOs have enjoyed in the past have not led to a high-
performing system in the present.  Citizens are outraged at the declining conditions of our 
national infrastructure, and the system that once was the envy of the world is continuing to 
spiral downward in comparison to other countries.  The American people are dodging potholes, 
experiencing unsafe driving conditions due to unfunded maintenance and preservation 
operations, and paying higher costs for vehicle maintenance and fuel usage due to 
deteriorating and rough roads.   The deteriorating infrastructure is impacting our national 
economy, impeding the movement of goods and services, and creating unnecessary injuries 
and fatalities.  
Some State Transportation Officials and MPO officials will undoubtedly be commenting that 
they need even more flexibility in their use of Federal-aid dollars.  I would argue that exactly 
the opposite is true.  If flexibility was the answer, we would still have the best highway network 
in the world.  It is an unfortunate situation that Congress has had to enact legislation to require 
performance measures and reporting by the States and MPOs, but the old system hasn’t 
provided sufficient incentives for most of the State and MPO transportation officials to stay 
focused on taking good care of our existing assets.  Typically these State officials are appointed 
by the Governor of their individual State, and political influences often result in more emphasis 
on politically-expedient projects rather than the rather mundane maintenance and 
preservation aspects of their jobs.  This situation is even more pervasive at the MPO level, 
where the mere collection of condition data is extremely rare.  Yet it is exactly those 
management requirements for maintenance and preservation that will have the largest long-
term impacts on the funding requirements for the States and MPOs.  States and MPOs that do 
poor jobs in this area will eventually require more Federal support to bail them out of the holes 
into which they are digging themselves.  
There is an inherent Federal interest in our roads and bridges.  The American people have 
supported the construction and on-going development of a vast network of roads and bridges, 
and it is well-proven that a system which is maintained in good condition is less expensive to 
maintain that one that has deteriorated.  Good roads cost less, and good roads are safer than 
bad roads – and performance measures will help FHWA gather and evaluate the data that is 
needed to preserve and protect the highway network that is important to America’s national 
interest.  There should be no flexibility offered to the States in the collection and analysis of this 
essential data.",0,0

Comments of DRAFT: National Performance Management Measures; Assessing Pavement Condition 
for the National Highway Performance Program and Bridge Condition for the National Highway 
Performance Program
Comments from ODOT Bridge Section
February 11, 2015
 Proposed Measures for bridges are simple and based on readily available data.  
 State’s discretion for setting targets is appropriate.
 Comment:  The rule sets up a point of future ongoing conflict between the state’s right of project 
selection and the Federal interference in the state’s ability to manage highway infrastructure to 
meet traffic demands and assure public safety.  The Federal role should be limited to setting overall 
goals and standards, but retain the long standing position that states select where and when they 
expend both State and Federal funding.  The rule should be clear that the line between project 
selection and achievement of overall goals and target will continue to be honored at the state 
(FHWA Division Office) level.
 The Rule contains specific dates for setting target and preparing investment plans that include a 
program of projects to address how the state will meet the targets.
Comment:  The level of effort and coordination with local agencies, the public and other 
stakeholders is not a trivial undertaking.  The assumption that states can revise or otherwise 
interrupt and fit this extremely complex and time consuming process to fit a schedule for these 
Federal Performance Measures that only address a small portion of the complex performance issues 
for a state transportation system devalues and trivializes this complex planning effort.  Instead of 
imposing timing deadlines for setting the targets and setting investment plans, the Federal 
requirements should be flexible and set in cooperation between the state and the local FHWA 
Division office to meet the schedule as set by the state DOT and their stakeholders.  Reporting at the 
Federal level could be based on any time frames set by the State DOT within a given calendar year of 
a given Federal fiscal year.  The language “significant progress” should be revised to “adequate 
progress considering fiscal and project delivery timeframes”.
 The Rule preamble discusses the bridge penalty based on an assessment of the bridge measures 
meeting the 10% minimum structurally deficient (Poor) bridges.
Comment:  MAP21 has provisions for a penalty that requires a minimum amount of funding 
allocated toward reducing the percentage of structurally deficient bridges if the minimum 10% 
target is not met.  With the adoption of the new bridge measures and requirements for investment 
plans aimed at meeting targets, the Legislation should be revised to eliminate any specified funding 
amount to be allocated.  Instead the state should be required to prepare an investment plan that 
addresses the need to reduce the percentage in the most cost effective manner without any 
arbitrary investment level. 
 The preamble discusses reporting on bridges owned by Federal agencies, but the Rule does not 
mention those bridges specifically.

May 11, 2015 2
Comment:  States have no direct authority to collect data on Federally owned bridges.  In fact there 
is no expectation and no requirement or mechanism for states to obtain bridge data on Federally 
owned bridges.  The Rule should set up a separate requirement for Federal bridge owner to report 
on the performance measures for those bridges.  Since the funding mechanisms are different and 
not controlled by States, the targets and assessment of progress for Federally owned bridge should 
be completely separate from the state targets, assessment and investments plans to reach targets.  
The Rule or preamble should clarify that only Federal bridge owners will report on Federally owned 
bridges and that State have no requirement or expectation to report on those bridges or to address 
them in investment plans.
 The rule requires reporting measures for NHS bridges only.  
Comment:  States must consider all bridges regardless of the system when setting up maintenance, 
preservation or replacement programs.  State plans to use available transportation funds should be 
developed based on priorities that consider the system, traffic volume, and condition, but non-NHS 
needs must also be addressed in order to maintain economic viability and mobility across an entire 
transportation system.  If the National Measures are really intended to be used to measure system 
improvement resulting from investments, both NHS and non-NHS systems should be reported so a 
comprehensive view of a state’s investment strategies will be presented.  
 The consequence of failing to meet targets is that consideration is given to how to meet in the next 
plan cycle.  
Comment:  This is an appropriate level of consequences.
 The definitions of G-F-P are based on National Bridge Inventory condition ratings for deck, 
superstructure and substructure.  
Comment:  An increasing number of states are no longer collecting NBI ratings, but are now 
collecting the New AASHTO Element Level ratings and converting to the NBI ratings using an 
approximate computerized algorithm.  The Rule should note that the use of NBI ratings for the 
definitions of the measures is temporary and will transition to the new definitions based on the new 
National Element Level ratings as defined by AASHTO.  The Rule should state that new definitions 
based on element level ratings will be developed jointly by FHWA and AASHTO, or at least that 
AASHTO input will be considered in developing definitions of the measures based on element level 
ratings.  
 The two performance measures included for bridge are the percentage of NHS bridges classified in 
good condition; the percentage of NHS bridges classified in poor condition based on deck area. 
Comment:  We believe the use of Good, Poor gives an imprecise view of conditions and lead to 
confusing interpretation of the measures.  We recommend the use of Cyclic Maintenance (CM for 
Good), Preventive Maintenance (PM for Fair) and Replacement or Rehab (R&R for Poor), as outlined 
by the AASHTO SCOPM in 2014.  
Comment: I would expect the two performance measures could be misleading as the goal is for the 
percentage of good bridges to increase with the percentage of poor bridges to decrease. To sustain this 
approach, funding would need to be spent on good bridges to keep them good and either rehabilitating",0,0

Re: Comment of Public.Resource.Org and The Center for Auto Safety 
 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
 Docket Number: FHWA USDOT -2013-0053 
Dear Sir or Madam: 
Public.Resource.Org (Public Resource) and the Center for Auto Safety (CAS) submit 
this comment to object to one aspect of the proposed Federal Highway 
Administration (FHWA) regulation : It proposes to incorporate by reference ten 1
public safety standards that are not reasonably available to people affected by the 
rule, as required by law.  
Public Resource and the Center for Auto Safety are not commenting here on the sub-
stantive merits of the proposed rule. Instead, we ask the FHWA to recognize that it 
has acted illegally and arbitrarily at this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) 
stage in not making these standards—which are integral parts of the rule— available 
to our organizations and other members of the public without having to pay for them. 
This unwarranted action by FHWA places an unreasonable burden on members of 
the public who wish to review the entire rule in order to fully understand it and to 
make appropriate comments.  
 A ﬁnal rule that incorporated the standards without making them freely available 
would be equally invalid. The new regulation would make these standards part of the 
law, yet FHWA proposes to exclude the texts of these standards from the text of the 
regulation. Nor does FHWA propose to link the online version of the regulation to 
websites offering free and unrestricted access to the standards. Instead, FHWA 
opines that interested persons should already own the standards or can go purchase 
them.

FHWA USDOT -2013-0053, PAGE  2
In sum, FHWA has invited the public to comment on a law, and proposed that citizens 
be compelled to obey a law, that many affected parties cannot reasonably afford to 
read.  
This failure to make the ten public safety standards, proposed to be part of the rule, 
reasonably available denies people basic access to their own laws, the laws they are 
both bound to obey and dependent upon for protection from serious dangers.  In so 
doing, the proposed rule violates the Freedom of Information Act, the Due Process 
Clause of the Constitution, and the fundamental principle of responsive governments 
worldwide for millennia— that people are entitled to read and speak the laws that 
govern them, with no restrictions.   
Because it is illegal and arbitrary to publish this proposed rule without making 
incorporated standards freely available, FHWA should re-publish the proposed rule 
with the ten incorporated public safety standards available online for free and re-
open the comment period.  As to any ﬁnal rule, FHWA may not lawfully incorporate 
these ten standards into its regulation until and unless they are written directly into 
the rule, or else permanently available to the public on a website without charge and 
without any restriction whatsoever on use.  
1. The Proposed Incorporation by Reference 
The NPRM proposes performance measures for state Departments of Transportation 
to use to carry out the National Highway Performance Program (NHPP) and to assess 
the condition of pavements on the National Highway System (NHS) (excluding the 
Interstate System), bridges on the NHS, and pavements on the Interstate System.  
According to the NPRM, FHWA “intends to make these performance aspects of the 
NHPP available to the public in a format that is easily understandable and accessible 
for download. ”  Yet FHWA then undercuts its position by proposing that some of the 
content of the proposed rule in fact be shielded from the public and instead hidden 
behind a paywall.  
FHWA proposes to incorporate by reference 10 standards published by American 
Association of State Highway and Transportation Ofﬁcials (AASHTO) “to codify the 
method and/or the device used to collect data for the metrics (i.e., IRI, Crack-
ing_Percent, rutting, and faulting). ”  
In other words, the incorporation of the ten standards is aimed at improving public 
safety by mandating the ways in which data collection will be accomplished for 
purposes of promoting compliance with important safety rules.  But if compliance 
with the standard is to be maximized, then people need ready access to the standard. 
Unfortunately, the proposed rule fails to make the standards reasonably available. 
2. Availability of the Standards 
The texts of the ten standards that FHWA proposes to incorporate into the rule are 
not included in the rule itself, nor has FHWA placed any of the ten standards online,",0,0

Dear Acting Administrator Nadeau: 
Marin County appreciates the opportunity to comment on Federal Highway 
Administration {FHWA)'s proposed rule on National Performance Management 
Measures for Pavement and Bridge Conditions. 
Marin County maintains approximately 420 miles of roadway including 
approximately 100 miles of arterials and 65 miles of collector roads. The County 
annually monitors and measures the pavement conditions of our roadways and 
develops and implements an annual resurfacing program. This program includes 
applications to extend the life of the pavement as well as major pavement 
rehabilitation projects. Over the last 8 years, the County has invested over $50 
million dollars to improve pavement conditions and safety. 
Pavement Condition: 
Marin County is part of the Metropolitan Transportation Commission {MTC} 
region in the San Francisco Bay Area. In the MTC region, all the jurisdictions have 
adopted the same pavement condition metric, the Pavement Condition Index 
{PCI}. The MTC region has been practicing pavement management for over 30 
years, and local jurisdictions in the Bay Area must have a certified pavement 
management program in place in order to be eligible to receive regionally 
F:\AdministrativeStaff\SDeMartini\CT\ TEMPLATE for Jurisdictionsfhwa nprm- Copy-2 BG.docx 

allocated funds for local street and road maintenance and rehabilitation. In California, 
local jurisdictions own and maintain most of the arterials and collector roadways in 
addition to the residential streets. The state is generally responsible for the higher 
speed facilities (namely highways and interstates). 
There are important local implications of the federal proposed rule. We respect FHWA's 
struggles and careful consideration in proposing a single performance measurement for 
pavement; however the adoption of the International Roughness Index (IRI) is a 
measure that results in inaccurate performance assessments for local facilities. We are 
concerned that the benefit of having a single nationwide standard, comes at the 
expense of local jurisdictions. IRI is not an appropriate measure for local roadways and 
the introduction of an additional layer of performance measurement on top of local 
jurisdictions' existing methods, injects unnecessary expense and creates confusion that 
can only hinder asset management efforts at the local level. With federal transportation 
legislation over the years, there has been a devolution of responsibilities where there is 
an accepted premise that one size doesn't fit all and that decisions are best made at the 
local level with broad guidance from the Federal government. It is in this context that 
we submit our comments. 
Our comments are broadly centered around 3 main points: 
1} IRI is appropriate for highway facilities but is not appropriate for arterials, which 
make a sizable share (approximately 36%) of the NHS in California under MAP-
21. We have outlined a number of reasons why using IRI as a key component of 
MAP-21 pavement condition performance measures raises concerns for local 
jurisdictions: 
o The selected measure should be applicable to the facility for an accurate 
measurement of performance; adoption of the IRI appears to be based 
on data availability and less on appropriateness to facility. IRI measures 
the functional property of a pavement, whereas the measure we are 
currently using, PCI, is primarily a structural condition measurement. 
The measurement of functionality, or ride quality, is important for 
facilities with high speed travel; however, not very significant for the 
lower speeds that typically occur on arterial roadways. 
o An outcome of applying IRI to local roads is that it would encourage a 
shift away from preventive preservation treatments to costlier 
rehabilitation and reconstruction projects. Marin County has 
implemented slurry seal and bond wearing course applications to extend 
pavement life by ten or more years. IRI, however, which measures and 
uses criteria based upon smoothness measures, is a reactive measure 
when applied to local streets and if used as an asset management tool, 
may lead to ""worst first"" maintenance strategies that are not as cost­
effective. Pavement condition index (PCI) which allows a visual inspection

RE: FHWA Docket Number FHWA-2013-0053, National Performance Management 
Measures; Assessing Pavement Condition for the National Highway Performance 
Program and Bridge Condition for the National Highway Performance Program 
Dear Acting Admini~trator Nadeau: 
The City of Gilroy appreciates the opportunity to comment on Federal Highway 
Administration (FHWA)'s proposed rule on National Performance Management Measures 
for Pavement and Bridge Conditions: 
Below, we voice some of our comments on the proposed rulemaking being considered by 
the FHWA as referenced above. 
Pavement Condition: 
The City of Gilroy is part of the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) region in the 
San Francisco Bay Area. In the MTC region, all the jurisdictions have adopted the same 
pavement condition metric, the Pavement Condition Index (PCI). The MTC region has been 
practicing pavement management for over 30 years, and local jurisdictions in the Bay Area 
must have a certified pavement management program in place in order to be eligible to 
receive regionally allocated funds for Local Street and road maintenance and rehabilitation. 
In California, local jurisdictions own and maintain most of the arterials and collector 
roadways in addition_ to the residential streets. The City of Gilroy, as do most cities in the 
state, has goals in place that strive to maintain a minimum average PCI. We have had this 
goal in place -for many years. The state is generally responsible for the higher speed 
facilities (namely highways, freeways, and interstates). 
There are important local implicatiol)s of the federal proposed rule. We respect FHWA's 
struggles and careful consideration in proposing a single performance measurement for 
pavement; however the adoption of the International Roughness Index (IRI) is a measure 
that results in inaccurate performance assessments for local facilities: We are concerned 
that the benefit of having a single nationwide standard comes at the expense of local 

jurisdictions. IRI is not an appropriate measure for local roadways and the introduction of 
an additional layer of performance measurement, on top of local jurisdictions' existing 
methods, injects unnecessary expense and creates confusion that can only hinder asset 
management efforts at the local level. With federal transportation legislation over the years, 
there has been devolution of responsibilities where there is an accepted premise that one 
size doesn't fit all and that decisions are best made at the local level with broad guidance 
from the Federal government. It is in this context that we submit our comments. 
Our comments are broadly centered around 3 main points: 
1) I Rl is appropriate for highway facilities but is not appropriate for arterials, which make 
sizable share (approximately 36%) of the NHS in California under MAP-21. We have 
outlined a number of reasons why using IRI as a k.ey component of MAP-21 
pavemer)t condition performance measures raises concerns for local jurisdictions: 
• The selected measure should be applicable to the facility for an accurate 
measurement of performance; adoption of the IRI appears to be based on 
data availability and less on appropriateness to facility. IRI measures the 
functional property of a pavement, whereas the measure we are currently 
using, PCI, is primarily a structural condition measurement. The City of Gilroy 
has also developed pavement treatments largely based on the PCI. A rating 
of ""good"" or ""poor'' based on the IRI would not be very useful to the city. The 
measurement of functionality, or ride quality, is important for facilities with high 
speed travel; however, not as significant for the lower speeds that typically 
occur on arterial roadways. 
• An outcome of applying IRI to local roads is that it would encourage a shift 
away from preventive preservation treatments to costlier rehabilitation and 
reconstruction projects, and an overall decline in average pavement condition. 
IRI is a reactive measure when applied to local streets and if used as an asset 
management tool, may lead to ''worst first"" maintenance strategies that are 
not as cost-effective. Pavement condition index (PCI) is a more proactive 
measure as it identifies pavement distresses before they affect ride quality. 
• The City of Gilroy currently uses PCI for measuring road condition and does 
not collect IRI data. In order to meet the federal requirements, we would 
either need to collect IRI data or convert PCI scores to IRI using questionable 
methodologies. Furthermore, less than 5% of the roads in California are part 
of the NHS and collection strategies on less than 5% of the roads should not 
drive the asset management approach for the rest of the system. 
To address this issue, we suggest adopting a select list of certified and widely-used 
alternative pavement condition measures with an accompanying standardized 
definition of the scoring equivalency to good, fair, and poor that would be accepted, in 
addition to the IRI. This would enable States to make accurate and comparable 
assessments of the pavement system. 
2) The formula for calculating performance is based on IRI, cracking, and 
rutting/faulting. As with IRI, the performance assessment formulas for highway-type 
) 
facilities and arterials should also be varied based on appropriateness to the facility. 
The pattern of roadway deterioration and wear and tear is different for highway and 
arterials. On arterials, cracking can be derived from factors such as utility trenches 
and may be very different from the cracking that occurs on highways.

Reducing traffic crashes involving motorcycles and decreasing the number of motorcycle 
operators and passengers injured or killed each year is a top priority of the AMA. Through a 
comprehensive approach that entails promotion of rider education, use of personal protective 
equipment, increased motorist awareness, discouraging impaired motorcycle operation and 
ensuring safe riding surfaces, the AMA seeks to enhance motorcycle safety and promote the use 
of motorcycles for transportation and recreation. 
Therefore, the AMA strongly recommends that 23 U.S.C. § I 09 be amended to reflect the safety of

Re: Comment of Public.Resource.Org and The Center for Auto Safety 
 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
 Docket Number: FHWA USDOT -2013-0053 
Dear Sir or Madam: 
Public.Resource.Org (Public Resource) and the Center for Auto Safety (CAS) submit 
this comment to object to one aspect of the proposed Federal Highway 
Administration (FHWA) regulation : It proposes to incorporate by reference ten 1
public safety standards that are not reasonably available to people affected by the 
rule, as required by law.  
Public Resource and the Center for Auto Safety are not commenting here on the sub-
stantive merits of the proposed rule. Instead, we ask the FHWA to recognize that it 
has acted illegally and arbitrarily at this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) 
stage in not making these standards—which are integral parts of the rule— available 
to our organizations and other members of the public without having to pay for them. 
This unwarranted action by FHWA places an unreasonable burden on members of 
the public who wish to review the entire rule in order to fully understand it and to 
make appropriate comments.  
 A ﬁnal rule that incorporated the standards without making them freely available 
would be equally invalid. The new regulation would make these standards part of the 
law, yet FHWA proposes to exclude the texts of these standards from the text of the 
regulation. Nor does FHWA propose to link the online version of the regulation to 
websites offering free and unrestricted access to the standards. Instead, FHWA 
opines that interested persons should already own the standards or can go purchase 
them.

In sum, FHWA has invited the public to comment on a law, and proposed that citizens 
be compelled to obey a law, that many affected parties cannot reasonably afford to 
read.  
This failure to make the ten public safety standards, proposed to be part of the rule, 
reasonably available denies people basic access to their own laws, the laws they are 
both bound to obey and dependent upon for protection from serious dangers.  In so 
doing, the proposed rule violates the Freedom of Information Act, the Due Process 
Clause of the Constitution, and the fundamental principle of responsive governments 
worldwide for millennia— that people are entitled to read and speak the laws that 
govern them, with no restrictions.   
Because it is illegal and arbitrary to publish this proposed rule without making 
incorporated standards freely available, FHWA should re-publish the proposed rule 
with the ten incorporated public safety standards available online for free and re-
open the comment period.  As to any ﬁnal rule, FHWA may not lawfully incorporate 
these ten standards into its regulation until and unless they are written directly into 
the rule, or else permanently available to the public on a website without charge and 
without any restriction whatsoever on use.  
1. The Proposed Incorporation by Reference 
The NPRM proposes performance measures for state Departments of Transportation 
to use to carry out the National Highway Performance Program (NHPP) and to assess 
the condition of pavements on the National Highway System (NHS) (excluding the 
Interstate System), bridges on the NHS, and pavements on the Interstate System.  
According to the NPRM, FHWA “intends to make these performance aspects of the 
NHPP available to the public in a format that is easily understandable and accessible 
for download. ”  Yet FHWA then undercuts its position by proposing that some of the 
content of the proposed rule in fact be shielded from the public and instead hidden 
behind a paywall.  
FHWA proposes to incorporate by reference 10 standards published by American 
Association of State Highway and Transportation Ofﬁcials (AASHTO) “to codify the 
method and/or the device used to collect data for the metrics (i.e., IRI, Crack-
ing_Percent, rutting, and faulting). ”  
In other words, the incorporation of the ten standards is aimed at improving public 
safety by mandating the ways in which data collection will be accomplished for 
purposes of promoting compliance with important safety rules.  But if compliance 
with the standard is to be maximized, then people need ready access to the standard. 
Unfortunately, the proposed rule fails to make the standards reasonably available. 
2. Availability of the Standards 
The texts of the ten standards that FHWA proposes to incorporate into the rule are 
not included in the rule itself, nor has FHWA placed any of the ten standards online,",0,0
2014-30085,FHWA-2013-0053-0072,"One of the most critical problems in asphalt pavement construction today is achieving a long lasting longitudinal joint. It is costing agencies billions worldwide in premature repair of the joint. This problem has been recognized for a couple of decades, and discussed at many asphalt pavement seminars, the subject of much research, with little or no progress in many jurisdictions.<br/><br/>The problem stems from a lack of density on the edge of the first paved lane, as the compactor has nothing to compact against. This results in a push sideways at the edge, and a lack of compacted density on the outer 3-6 inches, typically 4-6 per cent less than the density of the mat. This lack of density, according to considerable research, can translate into a reduction of 20-35% in the life of a pavement, because a low density means more water penetration, more freeze thaw action, more moisture deterioration of the bitumen/aggregate bond. Further, it means a lower strength that is not capable of withstanding todays heavy traffic loads, and once the crack occurs, a concentration of load on each side of the crack as the wheel passes over, to further stress the joint area. <br/><br/>Historically, paving contractors were able to produce a better joint by limiting the length of a paved lane, moving back and matching the joint while reasonably hot. With traffic control making short paved lanes impractical, plus the advent of multi lane highways, moving back to match the warm joint has been all but eliminated on highways. Hence, a lack of density and water impermeability, and early deterioration of the joint.<br/>In a 2012 Asphalt Institute/Federal Highways Report: Best Practices for Constructing and Specifying HMA Longitudinal Joint, a 2002 Kentucky Transportation Center quote is provided :&quot; Many pavements have been, or are in the process of being, resurfaced as a direct or indirect result of longitudinal joint deteriorations. This statement is relevant today. <br/><br/>The report also cites an FHWA Division Office survey: half the respondents were not satisfied with the overall performance of longitudinal joints in their states. Thirty-five (35) states said they had some sort of longitudinal joint specification or special provision, but only half of those states (17) reported that they had a minimum density requirement at the joint. &quot;The minimum density required was as low as 89% leaving the pavement with a 35% reduction in life.  <br/><br/>Some states have actually specified that any quality control cores must be taken certain distances from the joint since it would not represent mat densities, and have no requirement to test the joint.  <br/><br/>The AI/FHWA study just covered the United States. The same problem exists in Canada, and worldwide. <br/><br/>With the serious lack of funding to continue maintaining our infrastructure, it becomes critical that this longitudinal joint construction problem be eliminated, so our roads can last longer. <br/><br/>FAA (Federal Aviation Authority) has handled this lack of joint density by specifying the removal of the cold un-compacted edge prior to matching with the new hot lane, then cores to verify density.  <br/>In the last several years, contractors have been allowed to re-heat the cold, un-compacted edge using infrared joint heaters to allow re-compaction along with the new hot lane being applied. This has proven much cleaner, faster, and less costly than removing the edge. Follow-up density testing has proven the joint to be constructed properly.<br/><br/>At the same time infrared joint heaters were proving themselves on critical airport pavements, progressive pavement owners started evaluation of joint heaters along with other joint making techniques to improve joint quality. <br/>Independent studies by University of Tennessee and Arkansas for their respective DOTs came out with the results that joint heating produced the highest density and lowest water permeability of several joint making techniques studied.   <br/>Dr Baoshan Huang, Associate Professor, and lead researcher for the University of Tennessee study stated in his final report published in the American Society of Civil Engineering Journal:  The infrared heater exhibited the best effectiveness in improving joint quality among all the joint construction techniques used in this study.<br/>Some agencies require echelon paving to eliminate a joint but this is not often practical. <br/>I At a recent Ontario, Canada Hot Mix Producers Seminar, the county engineer of one of the municipalities reported a unit cost quoted for echelon paving was about $2.00 per tonne as an extra, and about 0.25 cents per tonne for joint heating. <br/><br/> There has been a lack of emphasis on making the contractor produce a better joint since it appeared there was not a viable solution. Now there are solutions. One is the FAA solution which has been ignored, There is now echelon paving  and allowing the contractor to re-heat the edge with infrared. <br/><br/>By requiring a compacted joint, the highways will last longer. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>",2015-02-16T05:00:00Z,2015-02-14T05:00:00Z,,Bob,Kieswetter,,,Kitchener,Ontario,Canada,N2E 3X9,,,false,0,,,0,0

2014-30085,FHWA-2013-0053-0194,"One aspect of the pavement performance measures that should be considered is the exposure and risk factors associated with the rated conditions.  That is, the specified performance conditions should be the minimum allowable condition at any time on the Interstate System.  For example, after spring thaws or periods of significant inclement weather which has recently  happened over a large extent of the US, potholes can become frequent and can have a dramatic impact on safety based on their severity and the time of exposure to traffic. <br/><br/>The rationale described here is that good roads do not pothole, but poorer roads can receive good ratings if temporary repairs are made just prior to the annual evaluations.  The &quot;actual&quot; good roads will not incur the same exposure risk as will the &quot;poorer&quot; roads which rated good.  The current procedures appear to be based on annual assessments that only characterize the roadway at that moment in time and hence cannot account for the exposure risk.  This does not ensure the safety of the interstate system.<br/><br/>In addition to establishing a minimum condition goal, it might also be useful to look at other strategies to discriminate between a good road and a poorer road that rates good.  Although strategies like evaluating areas of localized roughness in profile evaluations could help delineate this issue, it would be labor intensive.  Perhaps using traffic as probe vehicles with a call in number for unacceptable road conditions could perform as a check on the current system and could be used as a means to require supplemental evaluations or actually to trump the annual evaluations and to change the rating.  There could also be another category of performance measure which would require repair of &quot;extreme conditions&quot; to ensure safety and minimize exposure.<br/><br/>During the several years that  these performance standards will be integrated into working practice, in-vehicle communications with the infrastructure are also being developed by the auto manufacturers and in the not to distant future traffic streams can be used to characterize the interstate system for the occurrences of unacceptable roadway conditions.",2015-06-15T04:00:00Z,2015-06-11T04:00:00Z,,Larry,Scofield,,,Mesa,AZ,United States,85210,,,false,0,,,0,0

The Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT) is pleased to submit the following comments 
on Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA) ""National Performance Management Measures; 
Assessing Pavement Condition for the National Highway Performance Program and Bridge Condition 
for the National Highway Performance Program;"" Proposed Rule (Docket Number FHWA-2013-0053) 
published in the Federal Register on January 2, 2015. RIDOT would like to commend FHWA for their 
extensive stakeholder engagement and outreach through the initial rollout of MAP-21 and the Notice 
of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM). Of particular value were the webcasts offered soon after the 
release of the NPRMs that provided RIDOT staff with the opportunity to learn more about the 
proposed rules. 
RIDOT supports the US DOT's and FHWA's efforts to establish consistent national performance 
measures to carry out the National Highway Performance Program. 
Consistent with AASHTO and the other State DOTs, RIDOT is supportive of the MAP-21 performance 
provisions and believes that the implementation of performance management principles within the 
transportation industry will be a positive step towards a safer and more efficient transportation 
system. RIDOT is, however, concerned with the need to balance the funding of programs and projects 
across areas, while meeting stakeholder expectations during a time of financial uncertainty. The 
condition of our infrastructure and achieving a state of good repair is one of the most critical 
components of RIDOT's mission as a State DOT. To achieve this, RIDOT has being working on a 10-Year 
plan that, once adopted, will enable RIDOT to achieve a ""State of Good Repair."" To this end, RIDOT will 
continue to work in partnership with FHWA, AASHTO and other State DOTs to address these challenges 
and meet the Department's goals. 
The following comments represent a substantial work effort between RIDOT's Office of Performance 
Management, Bridge Engineering, Highway Engineering, Research & Materials, and Asset 
Management. This included a coordinated effort to gather input from various sections within RIDOT 
that are responsible for both data collection and the implementation of programs. 

To: Gregory G. Nadeau, Deputy Administrator, Federal Highway Administration 
Subject: Docket No. FHWA-2013-0037 
Date: July 9, 2015 
Page 2 of4 
RIDOT is generally supportive of the comments provided by AASHTO as posted on the docket on April 
23, 2015 to the ""National Performance Management Measures; Assessing Pavement Condition for the 
National Highway Performance Program and Bridge Condition for the National Highway Performance 
Program"" proposed rule. In addition to those comments, RIDOT recommends that FHWA address the 
concerns outlined below and consider revisions to the proposed rule. 
The following are specific RIDOT recommendations: 
PRIORITIZATION: 
RIDOT recommends that FHWA incorporates into the proposed performance measures the associated 
Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT) to provide states the opportunity to prioritize projects with higher VMT. 
PENALTIES: 
It is RIDOT's belief that the application of the penalties included in the MAP-21 legislation and 
proposed in the NPRM is counter-productive to FHWA's and the States goal of achieving a ""State of 
Good Repair"" with our infrastructure assets. As FHWA is well aware and documented in many 
publications on Asset Management, including the most recent NPRM on Asset Management, achieving 
a State of Good Repair requires a multi-year strategic approach that puts preservation ahead of worse­
first. Unfortunately if FHWA moves ahead to impose the described penalties it will push the States into 
a worse-first approach, limiting needed flexibility and delaying the achievement of a State of Good 
Repair. To that extent the lack of a federal legislation providing predictable, consistent, and sufficient 
levels of funding poses a major obstacle in the transformation of the highway program to a 
performance and outcome-based program and any loss of flexibility by the States would further 
exacerbate the situation. 
BRIDGE: 
An increasing number of states are transitioning into using the new AASHTO Element Level ratings and 
converting to the NBI ratings using an approximate computerized algorithm rather than collecting NBI ratings. 
RIDOT is already collecting element level inspection data, but as a result of the underlying issues with the 
conversion algorithm also collects NBI level data which results in duplication of effort. RIDOT recommends that 
FHWA adopts the new AASHTO Element Level Ratings as part of this NPRM. 
It should be noted here that many State DOTs base their asset management approach on the following stated 
principles, which RIDOT recommends that FHWA also adopts as part ofthe NPRM. 
1. Routine or Cyclic Maintenance (CM) refers to work performed on pre-determined intervals and aimed to 
preserve existing bridge element or component conditions. Bridges with routine or cyclic preventive 
maintenance needs have very little deterioration. 
2. Condition Based Preventive Maintenance (PM) refers to work performed on bridge elements as needed 
and identified through the bridge inspection process. Bridges with condition based preventive maintenance 
needs have moderate deterioration, such as spalled bridge decks, leaking deck expansion joints, or steel 
beams needing paint.",0,0

SUBJECT: Comments on Docket ID: FHWA‐2013‐0053‐0073 National Performance Management 
Measures: Assessing Pavement Condition for the National Highway Performance Program and 
Bridge Condition for the National Highway Performance Program 
 
Agency Description and Background 
The Ada County Highway District (ACHD) was established in 1972 as an independent government entity 
responsible for all short‐range planning, construction, maintenance, operations, rehabilitation and 
improvements to Ada County’s urban streets, rural roadways (excluding state highways) and bridges. 
Geographically the District’s jurisdiction includes the cities of Boise, Eagle, Garden City, Kuna, Meridian, Star, and 
the unincorporated portions of the county and is considered the only countywide highway district in the State of 
Idaho. The District operates and maintains approximately 2,238 centerline miles of roads and streets. Our 
infrastructure includes facilities that range from multi‐lane arterial streets with a computerized signal system to 
narrow farm‐to‐market roadways.  
Pavement Management in Practice 
ACHD implemented a pavement management system (PMS) in 1987 and has been using the PMS to make cost‐
effective funding and maintenance decisions on road repairs, with a focus on pavement preservation policies 
since that time. ACHD has divided its network into approximately one‐half to one‐mile segments utilizing the 
StreetSaver database. Periodically ACHD contracts with a consultant to evaluate the condition of all arterials, 
collectors and local roads in the network resulting in a Pavement Condition Index (PCI) for each segment. ACHD 
has been utilizing PCI as its network condition measurable since 1987. 
 
ACHD utilizes the PCI information to determine the condition of the pavement sections and in determining the 
appropriate maintenance treatments within the framework of a PMS and thereby identifying funding 
requirements for project and network level purposes. At this current time ACHD has a network‐wide average PCI 
of 84. We are able to sustain a high PCI level by our dedication to pavement preservation practices and the 
quality of a cost‐effective chipseal that we are able to produce each season. On average ACHD applies 
approximately 4,000,000 square yards of chipseal each summer on a six year rotation through our network.  
Comments on Docket ID: FHWA‐2013‐0053‐0073 
This memo comprises ACHD’s comments on the proposed rules on pavement performance measures from the 
perspective of a local highway district that owns, maintains and operates 115 centerline miles of roadways on 
the National Highway System (NHS). Comments are as follows: 

 The ACHD has concerns pertaining to the use of the International Roughness Index (IRI) as a 
performance measure of local roads specifically pertaining to the following:  
o Capability of a profilometer to collect quality data at low speeds such as those on local 
streets and roads  
o Inertial profilometers must also operate at constant speed, making data collection in 
areas with stop signs, traffic signals, pedestrian crossings or congestion problematic.   
o Highly  textured  surfaces  such  as  chipseals  and  surfaces  with  a  large  quantity  of 
cracking or utility cuts can also pose problems for some profilometer designs.  
o The  continued  use  of  cost‐effective  pavement  preservation  techniques,  such  as 
chipseals may not be utilized as they have the potential to negatively impact the IRI.  
o IRI  is  not  used  as  a  trigger  for  maintenance  treatments  in  most  local  pavement 
management systems. ACHD utilizes the PCI protocol in the PMS to determine both 
the condition of the pavements as well as to make planning and funding decisions.  
 
 The PCI measures fundamentally different properties of a pavement, and while IRI and PCI are 
complementary, one cannot replace the other.  A case can be made that objective measures of 
roughness such as IRI are not very feasible or meaningful for local roads, and that IRI should 
therefore be dropped as a measure for local roads.   
 
 If IRI is dropped as a performance measure for local roads, then it may make sense for local 
agencies to measure rutting and faulting using manual means.  However, the manual methods 
allowed by the Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) still require specialized equipment.  For 
local agencies, alternative straight‐edge based methods would be much more practical and 
not significantly less accurate in the context of the proposed performance thresholds. 
 
 Cracking percent is very simplistic compared to the PCI data. However, due to inconsistencies in 
the survey methods, cracking percent cannot be directly computed from the PCI methodology.  
A major inconsistency is that cracking percent is only related to the area within the wheelpaths; 
however a PCI survey rates the entire lane width.   Treatment of random/secondary cracking 
associated with linear cracking is also inconsistent, as is the reporting interval.  
 
 The definition and means of computing cracking percent are unclear.  The NPRM states that “for 
asphalt sections, the cracking percent metric would be computed as the percentage of the total 
area, to the nearest whole percent, that are exhibiting cracking” (page 366).  However, some 
types of cracking such as longitudinal and transverse cracking are measured in linear units, and 
there is no rational way to express the quantity of this cracking in terms of area.  The Highway 
Performance Monitoring System (HPMS)  field manual defines cracking percent as an “estimate 
of percent area with fatigue type cracking for all severity levels for AC pavements” (page 4‐94), 
which does make sense, as fatigue type cracking is measured in units of area.   In order for 
cracking percent to be measured in a meaningful and repeatable manner, the NPRM must either 
describe how this metric is to be computed, or simply reference the HPMS field manual (the 
HPMS field manual is explicitly referenced by the NPRM only for CRCP pavements).",0,0

Th~ Town of Ti~uron is part of !he Metropolitan Transporta,tion Commi.ssion {MTC}

adopted the same pavement condition metric, the Pavement Condition Index (PCI). The 
MTC region has. been.practicing pavement management for over 30 years, and local 
jurisdictions in the Bay Area must have a certified pavement management program in

road maintenance and rehabilitation. 
In summary we are strongly oppo~ed to the change. away from PCI to International 
Roughness Index (IRI). The adoptionofthe lntern~tional Rough.ne~s Index (IRI) is-a 
measure that would result in inaccurate performance assessments for local facilities.

Over the past several years using appropriate pavement management and maintenance 
techniques we have seen our PCI increase from 65 to 73. 
Using IRIon local roads like Tiburon would encourage, perhaps even force, a shift away 
from preventive preservation treatments to costlier rehabilitation and reconstruction 
projects. If used as an asset management tool, it necessarily leads away from such 
treatments as slurry seals and toward ""worst first"" maintenance strategies that waste 
taxpayer monies. Pavement condition index (PCI) is a more proactive measure and 
better measure for the maintenance of local roads. For those of us who can remember, 
the Army Corps of Engineers developed PAVER many years ago as a way of prioritizing 
maintenance and managing pavement assets. This type of asset management, using PCI 
and developed by the Federal Government, is more appropriate for local roads than is 
the IRI developed by FHWA for freeways. 
I 
Eve,Yone-warits a freeway that lSsrrlOoth"";ndrides wetCP;,.hap-;that philosophy co~d ,._-...... ~-~---------~ _....._ :----' 
be extended to local roads, but we believe that there are three problems with this 
extension: 
1. Lower speeds make smoothness less of a concern. 
2. One large complaint in every municipality is speeding. Frankly, a little 
roughness on low speed roads helps reduce speeding 
3. Smoothness is not the best indicator of remaining life. A newly patched and 
slurried road might be a bit rough but it is in good condition. 
4. Road deterioration patterns and causes are different on local roads than 
freeways. 
Under the current proposal, small municipalities would incur additional expenses to 
fund the data collection for this change. While Caltrans has been collecting IRI data for 
California's NHS, this responsibility will likely fall to local agencies for local roads. There 
are two problems with this: 
1. It will suck money away from actual pavement maintenance into additional 
paperwork. 
2. This effort would be in addition to the useful tool of PCI ratings. Even collecting _ .~- --~ _ ·- - ----· - --.· - -----------~

Subject: Michigan State Transportation Commission Comments on Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking regarding National Performance Management Measures, Docket No. 
FHW A-20 13-0053 
Dear Deputy Administrator Nadeau: 
The Michigan State Transportation Commission (STC) and Michigan's Transportation Asset 
Management Council (TAMC) appreciate the opportunity to offer comments on the Federal 
Highway Administration's proposed performance measurement process for roads and bridges. 
The STC is a bipartisan policy-making board established in the Michigan constitution. Eighteen 
years ago, the STC worked with the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) to set 
ten-year goals for pavement and bridge conditions. The STC supported, encouraged and 
monitored MDOT' s work to measure and manage the condition of its pavements and bridges 
through its asset management process. The success of this effort is well-documented, and MDOT 
is considered a leading agency in the field of asset management. 
The TAMC was created by the Michigan Legislature nearly ten years ago. The TAMC and STC 
have worked together since then to move asset management efforts beyond state highways to 
include all federal-aid eligible roads under the jurisdiction of Michigan's 616local road agencies. 
That effort has been remarkably successful, building a coalition among very diverse agencies and 
creating common goals for system condition and performance. Although it took time to bring all 
parties to a common understanding of measures and methods, it was well worth it to have condition 
data that is easily understood and universally respected, even by members of the Michigan 
Legislature. 
Despite this strong history of support for performance measurement and asset management, we 
have significant concerns about the recently proposed federal rule. 
Performance management at the federal level is very welcome, but the timing of this rule is 
unfortunate. MAP-21 is about to expire-again. The Federal Highway Trust Fund is expected to

run short of funds later this summer - again. Historicaiiy reliable transportation user fees have 
lost their reliability, but no realistic permanent replacement for them is even being discussed. 
In the current political climate, even a historically bipartisan issue like transportation fundinKWill 
have a hard time making real progress in Congress. 
The transportation funding problems that exist for the federal government also exist for state 
governments, to such a degree that 15 states have taken it upon themselves to increase funding for 
investment in transportation in the past two years. 
Given this context, the STC would like to raise a few high-level concerns about the proposed 
pavement and bridge performance management rule; these concerns are expressed in the 
attachment ~at follows. We will leave more detailed comments to the many experts from state 
DOT s across the country who are likely also weighing in. 
Thank you again for the opportunity to provide comments. If you have any questions, please feel 
free to contact Frank Raha, Commi ssion Advisor, at 517-373-5507.
