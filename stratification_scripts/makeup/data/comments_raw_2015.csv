2014-30752,APHIS-2014-0018-0062,"April 15, 2015 <br/><br/>To Whom It May Concern:<br/><br/>The following are the comments of the Pennsylvania Livestock Marketing Association on the proposed rule regarding Approved Livestock Marketing Facilities (Docket No. APHIS-2014-0018). <br/><br/>We thank you for the chance to provide feedback on the proposed rule. While we appreciate the time and effort taken to update the regulatory scheme surrounding Approved Livestock Marketing Facilities, we feel that USDA missed the mark in components of this proposed rule that reduces ADT rule flexibilities for cattle moving to an Approved Livestock Marketing Facility. The proposal limits the flexibility to only cattle coming to the facility from a Farm of Origin. Additionally, defining Farm of Origin to the farm where livestock are produced or maintained for at least four months prior to movement is unnecessarily broad  restricting movement even more. <br/><br/>In Pennsylvania, most of our livestock markets do business with out-of-state customers on a regular basis. This is both a function of being a smaller state and of cattle movement patterns. Additionally, many of our customers selling at market are small producers who bring just one or a few head of cattle to market at a time. For these small producers, it would be extremely expensive to have to have a veterinarian visit the farm to write a health certificate, especially when you consider the fact the cost of this health certificate could only be spread out over a few animals at the most. <br/><br/>This added expense could drive producers to sell at a different market just to avoid crossing state lines. They also may consider selling out of the market environment where it is less likely animal health and livestock movement requirements. <br/><br/>This would lead to less traceability rather than more traceability. <br/><br/>Sincerely, <br/><br/>Pennsylvania Livestock Marketing Association <br/>",2015-04-16T04:00:00Z,2015-04-16T02:22:26Z,,PA,LMA,,,All Over,PA,United States,,,,false,0,,,0,0
2014-30752,APHIS-2014-0018-0059,"Dear Mr. Shea, <br/><br/>As the association representing local livestock auction markets in the state of South Carolina, we are writing to provide comments on the proposed rule regarding Approved Livestock Marketing Facilities (Docket No. APHIS-2014-0018). <br/><br/>Generally, we support the comments submitted by Dan Harris, president of the national Livestock Marketing Association. In particular, we share his concerns with the Farm of Origin changes to the ADT rule limiting the feasibility of us continue to do business with our out-of-state customers. Adult cattle coming into our markets are documented and inspected upon arrival, so this adjustment is unnecessary. <br/><br/>We also feel strongly that the agreement should remain in the regulation so markets have the ability to formally comment on any changes just as we are doing now. <br/><br/>In addition, we agree that the language in the proposed agreement should be adjusted so it is clear livestock markets are not solely responsible for all livestock movement and animal health requirements. Our producers, veterinarians, and animal health officials also play an important role. <br/><br/>Our final comment is unique to South Carolina. We have state inspectors that attend each of our livestock auctions. We feel this resource market owners should be able to be utilize, if they chose to do so, to help address the shortage of private veterinarians and increase traceability. This could be accomplished by allowing these state inspectors the ability to write health papers or alternative movement documents to keep livestock moving. <br/><br/>If you have any questions about these comments, please contact John Kissee at 770-596-0128. <br/><br/>South Carolina Livestock Marketing Association <br/>",2015-04-15T04:00:00Z,2015-04-15T21:25:18Z,,South Carolina,LMA,,,Columbia,SC,United States,,,,false,0,,,0,0

2014-30752,APHIS-2014-0018-0007,"The industry desperately needs these changes! As a Livestock Market operator in southern Michigan since 1956, we have seen many changes over the years, notably a decrease of Livestock Marketing options. We have several customers from northern Ohio that choose us to market their slaughter cattle. Requiring to have an IVCI issued by a vet for each consignment of slaughter cattle would not only be costly, but not necessary. These cattle go to slaughter and are inspected by USDA at their destination for harvest. To be an &quot;Approved USDA Livestock Facility&quot; to accept out of state slaughter cattle and be required to have a Vet at the site on sale days would serve no purpose. Our local vet on call would allow his/her services on the farms and not pin him/her down at our premise for 6 hours each sale day. These out of state consignments are currently and would be continued to be USDA back tagged, penned separate, not co mingled, and sent from our facilities to slaughter. In addition, they are individually identified with RFID or USDA approved metal ear tags. An &quot;Owner-Shipper&quot; statement to accompany the cattle is no problem for the farmers or truckers.

2014-30752,APHIS-2014-0018-0033,"To Whom It May Concern:<br/> <br/>I am writing to provide comments on USDAs proposed changes to the Approved Livestock Marketing Facilities and Animal Disease Traceability regulations (Docket No. APHIS-2014-0018).<br/> <br/>As the President and CEO of Clovis Livestock Auction, Im concerned about a couple pieces of this proposal. One major concern I have is with the market duties in the proposed Approved Livestock Marketing Facility agreement. To me, it seems USDA would like markets to serve as the police of animal movement requirements. This is a government role that should not be passed on to private businesses. While we work with our buyers and sellers to help them meet requirements by having a veterinarian at our market, enforcing regulations is not a role markets should have to take on. The markets duties in the Approved Livestock Marketing Facility agreement should be adjusted to reflect this.<br/> <br/>I also am concerned about the portion of the proposed rule making changes to what is required to bring adult beef cattle and dairy cattle of any age across state lines to an Approved Livestock Marketing Facility. Our auction market is located in eastern New Mexico, close to the Texas border. Due to this, we have many customers crossing state lines to sell or buy cattle.<br/> <br/>Under the proposal, out-of-state producers selling cattle 18 months of age or older would have to get a health certificate before bringing these cattle to sell at our market, unless the cattle are coming from the farm where they are born or have been for four months.  Getting a veterinarian to visit a farm and write a health certificate can be expensive. In this rule, USDA has recognized that access to large animal veterinarians is a very real problem.  My concern is that USDA could be driving customers away from selling out our market by requiring health certificates prior to arrival. This is unnecessary as we have a veterinarian at our market and also record needed traceability information when cattle arrive.<br/> <br/>I believe the farm of origin piece of the rule would have a negative impact on my business and put livestock markets that happen to be located close to a state line at a competitive disadvantage. Because of this, my strong recommendation is that USDA does not move forward this component of the proposed rule.<br/> <br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/> <br/>Sincerely,<br/>Charlie Rogers",2015-04-14T04:00:00Z,2015-04-13T21:21:36Z,,Charles,Rogers,,,Clovis,NM,United States,,,,false,0,,,0,0

RE: Comments regarding Docket No APHIS-2014-0018, Proposed Rule on Livestock Marketing Facilities  
On behalf of the Missouri Department of Agriculture, please consider these comments regarding Docket 
No APHIS-2014-0018, Proposed Rule on Livestock Marketing Facilities. 
Thank you for allowing comments on the proposed rule. Missouri is ranked in the top 10 in many 
livestock categories and currently has 106 state-federal licensed markets.  After careful review of the 
proposed changes, we would like to make the following recommendations and suggestions. 
Proposed Revisions to Part 71 
Currently livestock markets are licensed and approved through a joint cooperative effort of state and 
federal authority; we would hope this relationship would continue in the future.  However, it is unclear 
that this is the intent of the proposed regulations with references to section 8308 of the Animal Health 
Protection Act (AHPA, 7 U.S.C. 8301, et seq.) and the statement “At the discretion of APHIS, a State 
animal health official could also be a cosignatory on the agreement”. Additionally, the Approved 
Livestock Marketing Agreement is stated to be between a livestock marketing facility and APHIS.  It 
appears under the proposed regulations APHIS is extending its authority to livestock market facilities 
that are not federally licensed via their authority under the Animal Health Protection Act.  It would seem 
to be an overreach of federal authority if the facility is not meeting the marketing requirements to be 
federally licensed under 9 CFR 71.20. We sincerely hope this does not set precedence for the utilization 
of the AHPA from this point forward. 
The proposed market agreement gives the impression the state will be engaged in the process. The 
livestock markets are currently licensed in our state by the state department of agriculture under the 
direction of the state veterinarian. However, we will again emphasize the need to keep the state in any 
agreements between APHIS and the livestock markets.   
Proposed Revisions to Part 86 
In Section 86.1, the “farm of origin” is defined as the location of the animals for a period of 4 months 
prior to movement.  How will livestock market owners be able to verify the animals comply with the 
“farm of origin” criteria upon arrival at the livestock market?  Would this mean without verification the 
animals would not qualify to move interstate without an ICVI and official identification to a livestock 
market that is also a “tagging site”? We feel this would be an undue burden on the livestock market 

and/or the accredited veterinarian at the market with little or no way of verification possible other than 
the seller’s word.  
In Section 86.5, we agree with the clarification to allow animals to move interstate to a livestock market 
facility without an ICVI or owner-shipper statement when the livestock market is collecting all the 
necessary information that would normally be captured on a movement document if this is allowed by 
the state of destination. 
Proposed Revisions to the Approved Livestock Marketing Agreement 
We are opposed to the removal of the requirement that an accredited veterinarian, State or APHIS 
representative must be on the premises at all times on sale days to perform duties in accordance with 
State and Federal regulations.  In the event APHIS feels the need no longer exists for a veterinarian to be 
present at the livestock market on sale days, we would like clarity to ensure the state’s authority would 
be recognized.   
We believe the presence of an accredited veterinarian is crucial to ensure the health and welfare of 
animals marketed through the facility.  In addition, it ensures we have individuals who are experts in the 
field of veterinary medicine available to provide early detection of disease in our livestock markets. The 
livestock markets assemble animals from a variety of locations within the United States and co-mingle 
and disperse them throughout the United States after the sale.  To protect the health of our animals it is 
absolutely critical through early detection that we have veterinarians on site to examine animals 
entering into commerce through our livestock markets to enhance or ensure early detection of disease. 
The presence of the accredited veterinarian at our livestock markets ensures that livestock market 
employees are adhering to the federal regulations.  The absence of this individual would leave the 
livestock market owners to self regulate. Would they also be required to self report any variance from 
the federal requirements?  Would APHIS rely on the biannual inspections to ensure compliance?  
Currently in the event of a disease trace, the livestock market veterinarian is relied upon and in many 
cases expected to provide the required information to authorities.  
The lack of veterinarians in certain regions of the United States should not be a driving force to change 
the requirement of an accredited veterinarian to be present in the livestock markets. Instead it should 
enhance the ability of a veterinarian to provide large animal veterinary service to livestock producers in 
the region.  The livestock market veterinarians in our state are paid through the services they provide to 
the livestock producers, thus serve as a means to improve the marketability of the animals and are 
considered an asset to the livestock producers and markets.  In addition, they ensure the livestock 
moving through the livestock market are handled in accordance to current animal handling standards 
accepted by NCBA and BQA Guidelines.  Their presence ensures animals that are injured during 
transport or at the livestock market are dealt with swiftly and humanely to prevent prolonged suffering. 
It is unclear who the authority would be at the livestock markets to determine when animals are known 
to be infectious, exposed, high-risk, etc. as referenced in III.A. 2, 5, and 6 if accredited veterinarians are 
not readily available as currently required.  The requirement for veterinarians to be present on the day",0,0

Docket Number: APHIS-2014-0018
Federal Register Vol. 80 No.1 January 2, 2015
Subject: Proposed Rule Livestock Marketing Facilities
I have been employed by the USDA-APHIS-VS for 36 years as an Animal Health Technician 
and 10 of those years as an Animal Identification Coordinator. I am submitting, for your 
consideration, my comments as a private citizen on the proposed changes to the Livestock 
Marketing Facilities regulations. The Livestock Marketing Facilities regulations continue to 
cause undue hardships to an important entity in the cattle industry, the Licensed Livestock 
Dealer.
I am referencing the statement in the Proposed Rules for Livestock Marketing Facilities 
under “Proposed Revisions to Part 86” paragraph 9:
After reviewing the relevant provisions of the agreement in 71.20 and how they have been 
implemented operationally, we agree with producers and State animal health officials that 
the information maintained by approved livestock marketing facilities for all livestock that 
enter the facility often includes all categories of information that are required on the 
owner-shipper statement. Thus, we are proposing to allow cattle and bison to be moved 
interstate to an approved livestock marketing facility without an accompanying owner-
shipper statement provided a State animal health official has waived the need for the owner-
shipper statement and all of the information required for an owner-shipper statement is 
recorded as soon as the cattle or bison are offloaded at the approved livestock marketing 
facility and this is maintained in accordance with the record retention requirements located 
in 86.3.
A Licensed Livestock Dealer is required by state laws to have a valid livestock dealer 
license in each state that they engage in the business of dealing in cattle. They must identify 
slaughter cattle and keep a record book. This record book contains the same information that 
is required on the owner shipper statement. Every cattle transaction, listing of official ID and 
backtag numbers, the date of purchase, repossessed, sold, traded or loaned, or from whom 
obtained and to whom the cattle are transferred is to be recorded in their dealer record book. 
There is a united concern among License Livestock Dealers that their sources of business and 
income would become public knowledge and jeopardized their business if they are required 
to provide the Livestock Marketing Facilities (LMF) with the names and addresses of the 
farms/producers where they obtain cattle from, as required with the owner-shipper statement 
regulations. By requiring the dealers to provide this information to the Livestock Marketing 
Facilities they are providing important confidential information to potential competitors, with 
no added benefit to the traceability system.

Final comments:
I propose that the requirement of the owner-shipper statement be modified so that the owner 
shipper statement does not require the name and address of where the animals originate for 
licensed livestock dealers. The LMF would be responsible for maintaining a record of which 
licensed livestock dealer delivered the animals to the LMF. The traceability can then be 
completed by using the licensed dealer records.
I respectfully submit for your consideration,

Comments on Proposed Rule Change for Livestock Marketing Facilities
Docket No. APHIS-2014-0018
RIN 0579-AE02
           Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Proposed Rule Change for Livestock 
Marketing Facilities. I am commenting as the Wyoming State Veterinarian, employed by the 
Wyoming Livestock Board. The board is a seven-member, governor-appointed board with 
statutory authority to license and regulate livestock markets in Wyoming. The board’s executive 
director has statutory authority to appoint a veterinarian, subject to board approval, as an 
authorized veterinarian for livestock markets. The proposed rule changes for livestock marketing 
facilities are of interest to the board and to me since we share the responsibility of maintaining 
the health and protecting the ownership of Wyoming livestock.
The following comments express our concerns, questions, and suggestions to the draft 
proposal:
Section 71.1 Definition - The definition of “Approved Livestock Marketing Facility” 
should include language consistent with that in the definition of “Livestock Marketing Facility” 
by adding the words, “for sale or sale purposes,” between “assembled” and “and that has been 
approved under §71.20.”
In the paragraph, “Application of USDA Approved Back tags,” it is important to consider 
both the retention of the backtag and the safety of the person who is responsible for applying the 
tag. Both are of paramount importance. Also of significant importance is back tag collection at 
slaughter so recovery of the tag must also be highly considered. For best retention and recovery, 
we recommend that the back tag be placed on the dorsum at the level of the last thoracic 
vertebrae. APHIS should cooperate with FSIS to provide a tool that will retrieve a back tag if it 
is beyond the reach of personnel on the slaughter line.
It should be noted that, traditionally, back tag retention has been addressed with double 
tagging when all else fails.  However, when applied properly, one tag has proven to be more than 
sufficient as demonstrated in some regions where commingled, in-weight sales are the norm.
Additionally, because of regional differences, we suggest that any tag placement language in the 
rule be in the form of recommendations and guidelines, leaving any rules or requirements up to 
the state animal health officials.  Finally, APHIS may want to consider a “minimum back tag 
retention rate” as a requirement for the facility permit.
In the first paragraph of proposed revisions to Part 86, it states that cattle or bison are 
allowed to be moved through no more than one approved livestock marketing facility and then

directly to a recognized slaughtering establishment, and implies that the back tag may be applied 
at the recognized slaughtering establishment. We disagree with allowing cattle or bison moving 
through an approved livestock marketing facility to be back tagged at the recognized 
slaughtering facility. Once cattle or bison are moved through a market and are commingled, if 
they are not back tagged at the market, traceability is severely compromised. Such animals 
should be back tagged at the approved livestock marketing facility before moving to slaughter. 
Any cattle or bison moving through a market should be tagged before there is any chance of 
commingling, loss of origin identity, or leaving the first market. Conversely, if cattle or bison are 
moved directly from the farm of origin to a recognized slaughtering facility without any 
commingling, it should be allowed that the tags be applied at the slaughter facility; otherwise, all 
animals must be identified prior to shipment to maintain traceability.
Recognizing that the ADT rule only applies to animals crossing state lines, the livestock 
marketing facility rule does have authority on animals remaining within the state.  We propose 
that the rule state that all breeding class cattle be identified with either official ID or a USDA-
approved back tag prior to leaving the facility (in addition to any ADT requirements).  We also 
ask that it be required that USDA-approved back tags can only be removed under the following 
conditions:
1) At slaughter
2) When replaced with another USDA-approved back tag and the two recorded and kept on 
file for five years with the person /entity to which the replacement tag was issued.
3) When correlated with an official ID tag at an approved tagging site and kept on file for 
five years.
The paragraph, “Meaning of Directly to an Approved Livestock Marketing Facility,” 
states that the exemption pertains only to cattle and bison moved interstate from their farm of 
origin to an approved livestock marketing facility. Please clarify whether this exemption pertains 
only to cattle or bison intended strictly for movement to slaughter, or if it pertains to cattle or 
bison intended for other purposes such as breeding. Please also clarify whether cattle and bison 
moving directly from the farm of origin to an approved livestock marketing facility in the same 
state, and which are then moved from that first approved livestock marketing facility to a second 
approved livestock marketing facility in another state, are required to be qualified for interstate 
movement with back tags or official identification at the first approved livestock marketing 
facility and if an ICVI is required.
Meaning of Directly to an Approved Livestock Marketing Facility:   86.5 c 1&2 still are 
not clear.  It needs to be clarified that an owner-shipper statement is required (in lieu of a CVI) in 
all cases except farm to slaughter.  It also needs to clarify that the owner-shipper statement can 
be waived by the state vet in any of the cases if conditions are met by the livestock market.  We 
propose the following:
(c) Cattle and bison. Cattle and bison moved interstate must be accompanied by an 
ICVI unless:
(1) They are moved directly from their farm of origin to a recognized slaughtering 
establishment.
(2) They are moved directly from their farm of origin to an approved livestock 
marketing facility with an owner- shipper statement and then directly to a recognized 
slaughtering establishment. A State animal health official may waive the requirement for 
an owner-shipper statement to accompany such cattle and bison, provided that:
(i) All the information required for the owner-shipper statement is recorded as soon 
as the cattle or bison are offloaded at the approved livestock marketing facility; and",0,0

Livestock should be tagged as soon as they arrive at the marketing facility from farm of origin whether interstate or intrastate.  Veterinarians have not been at the local sale barns all day around here in years and the rules should reflect this. Having a veterinarian &#39;on call&#39; is fine.,2015-01-05T05:00:00Z,2015-01-03T02:05:42Z,,Elizabeth,Mitchell,,,Brush Creek,TN,United States,,,,false,0,,,0,0

Your proposed rule stood out to me as I had previously taken an animal law seminar in which I wrote a paper focusing, in part, on the interstate transportation of rodeo broncs. In doing so, I spoke about the federal Twenty-Eight Hour Law (49 USC 80502) as well as the regulations adopted by the United States Department of Agriculture as mentioned in 9 C.F.R. 89. Noticing that your proposed rule overlaps with much of research I encountered in writing my paper, I would offer the following comments as to the proposed revision to Part 71.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>I understand the practicality of your decision to revise 71.20 as simply requiring a veterinarian on-call rather than on the premise at all times, however I am concern that the language in this section is too board as to who determines whether an animal may need an interstate certificate of veterinary inspection (ICVI) before leaving the facility after sale. For example, should this determinate be left up to someone who profits financially from having these animals shipped to another facility despite their health conditions, I have serious concerns for its vague phrasing.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Further, the restatement in 71.20(a) of 8303 of the Animal Health Protection Act (AHPA, 7 U.S.C. 8301 et seq.) stating that APHIS may carry out operations and measures to control, or eradicate any pest or disease of livestock also seems rather ambiguous. I understand that should pests or disease be detected in livestock, there is a strong health and safety interest in having them eradicated, however being a strong animal welfare advocate I would simply ask that this be done as humanely as possible by adding said language to your restatement.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Jennifer Trunk",2015-01-15T05:00:00Z,2015-01-13T19:01:13Z,,Jennifer,Trunk,,,Plantation,FL,United States,,,,false,0,,,0,0

2014-30752,APHIS-2014-0018-0011,"Not sure if this relates directly to the proposed changes, but two points:<br/><br/>1) The ADT Rule has created a potential &quot;traceability loophole&quot; in allowing cattle to move interstate to an approved tagging site with no ID and no CVI. This should happen only if the receiving tagging site is required to tag with official ID and maintain records in such a manner that animals are traceable back to the state and ship-from location. For example, Virginia allows breeding age cattle to be imported with no ID and no CVI if they are moving to an approved market and tagging site in VA, but they require that cattle are tagged with 840 RFID and usually a back tag that can be correlated with seller/buyer records in market files. The 840 tag provides traceability going forward; the back tag provides backward traceability.<br/><br/>2) It is difficult to get dairy calves/steers tagged with official ear tags at Virginia markets due to number of animals handled. If these animals are moving to other states in a fairly direct manner (similar to cull cattle), back tags may provide adequate traceability if correlated with seller/buyer records on both ends (shipping and receiving locations). Current back tags could (if appropriate) also be scanned with bar code readers to improve efficiency and accuracy of data capture. For example, dairy calves/steers in VA tagged with back tags and correlated to seller/buyer records; animals could be tagged with ear tags in receiving state, which should be correlated with VA back tags. Back tags are cheap, unique when paired with a date and location, stay on fairly well for short-term movements and are easier to capture than metal tags.",2015-02-18T05:00:00Z,2015-02-17T22:47:21Z,,Rick,Odom,,,Charlottesville,VA,United States,,,,false,0,,,0,0

RE: Docket No. APHIS-2014-0018, Proposed Rule on Livestock Marketing Facilities 
On behalf of The Humane Society of the United States and our members and supporters, thank 
you for the opportunity to submit public comment in response to the proposed rule regarding 
regulations governing approval of facilities that receive livestock moved in interstate commerce.  
These comments address the proposal to amend the Approved Livestock Marketing Facility 
Agreement under §71.20 to remove the requirement that an accredited veterinarian, State 
representative, or APHIS representative must be on the premises at all times on sale days.1 
The Federal Register Notice states that the requirement should be removed because when the 
rule was established, communicable livestock diseases were more prevalent in the United States, 
and it was more crucial for a veterinarian, APHIS Representative, or State representative to be on 
site to process paperwork, conduct testing, and ensure the isolation of high-risk livestock to 
prevent disease transmission.  However, communicable livestock diseases certainly still exist.2 In 
fact, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations describes animal 
transport as “ideally suited for spreading disease,” given that animals may originate from 
different herds or flocks and are “confined together for long periods in a poorly ventilated 
stressful environment.”33   The presence of a veterinarian or state/APHIS representative has 
utility beyond completing paperwork.  These individuals are qualified to identify problems and 
evaluate risks at livestock marketing facilities before they become larger problems. 
The HSUS urges APHIS to consider how susceptible livestock being moved through livestock 
marketing facilities are, not only to communicable disease, but to stress, injury, and inhumane 
treatment.  Veterinarians in particular are uniquely situated to intervene at livestock marketing 
facilities if needed to protect the safety of the food supply, or the well-being of animals at the 
facilities.

ASPCA, HSUS Re: Docket No. APHIS-2014-0018 
Operators of a livestock marketing facility have a financial stake in the animals at the facility, 
which could lead to under-reporting of animal disease.  Laypersons are also much less qualified 
to make a determination that an animal presents a disease risk than veterinarians or state/APHIS 
representatives. By transferring authority over inspecting livestock for diseases from 
state/APHIS representatives or veterinarians to individuals operating livestock marketing 
facilities, the proposed rule opens the door to potential conflicts of interest that put public and 
animal health at risk.  
Cost savings are not a sufficient justification for the increased threats to public health and animal 
health and welfare that this proposed rule presents.  APHIS should retain the requirement in the 
Approved Livestock Marketing Facility Agreement that a veterinarian, State representative, or 
APHIS representative be present at livestock marketing facilities during sale hours.  Failure to 
retain this requirement could amount to a violation of 7 U.S.C. 8301(5)(B), and thus subject the 
agency to potential litigation under the Administrative Procedure Act.  7 U.S.C. 8301(5)(B) is 
the authorizing legislation for 9 C.F.R. 71.2, and tasks APHIS with the duty “to protect the 
agriculture, environment, economy, and health and welfare of the people of the United States.”  7 
U.S.C. 8301(5)(B).  Failure to require a veterinarian, State representative, or APHIS 
representative to be present during operating hours would pose harm to health and welfare of the 
animals and the safety of the food chain.  
Particularly as APHIS proposes to change other requirements for transport and identification in 
this proposed rule, the supervision of a veterinarian or state or APHIS representative could prove 
invaluable in ensuring that APHIS-approved livestock marketing facilities represent safe 
facilities with sufficient oversight to ensure the safety of the animals moving through them and 
the safety of the agricultural economies that depend on them.

I am writing for the Indiana State Board of Animal Health (BOAH) to comment on the proposed 
rule governing livestock market facilities, docket number APHIS-2014-0018. 
Veterinarians at Markets 
The proposed rule would allow approved livestock marketing facilities to have a veterinarian on 
· cattotrsate-aayrath:ertnanrequire--rne pnystc-atpresenceor-a-vetertnarianaur1ng-atl-sate~r:­
BOAH supports this change. Many markets in Indiana are unable to find a veterinarian that is 
willing to be at the market for an entire sale, just in case a certificate of veterinary inspection is 
needed. Allowing markets to have an on-call arrangement with a veterinarian is a reasonable 
approach to accommodate the reality of the veterinary services market and meet the federal 
animal disease traceability rule requirements. 
Cattle and Bison Moved to Markets 
The proposed rule seeks to clarify that cattle and bison may be moved interstate to a market 
without identification if they are moved from the farm of origin to a market and the market 
applies the identification. 9 CFR 86.4. Cattle and bison may not be moved from one market 
interstate to another market without ID. The first market must ID the animals before they are 
moved interstate to another market. BOAH supports this proposed clarification. 
The proposed rule seeks to clarify that animals may be moved interstate to a market without a 
certification of veterinary inspection (CVI) if they are moved from the farm of origin to an 
approved livestock marketing facility. 9 CFR 86.5. Cattle and bison may not be moved from a 
market interstate to another market without a CVI. The first market must provide a CVI for 
interstate movement. BOAH 
supports this proposed clarification. 
Page 11 

Calves 
The current traceability rule allows movement of sexually intact beef calves under 18 months of 
age without listing each identification individually on the CVI. This exception does not apply to 
sexually intact dairy cattle of any age. 9 CFR 86.5( c )(7). BOAH believes that the rule should be 
amended to allow movement of sexually intact dairy bull calves under 18 months of age with 
identification on a CVI that does not list each of the identification individually. 
Many dairy calves move through livestock markets in a manner similar to beef calves. Reading 
tags in the ears of dairy bull calves as they move through a market can be very difficult and time 
consuming. BOAH believes it is important that these animals be tagged with official 
identification. However once 
the animals are tagged, sufficient traceability for the dairy bull 
calves can be maintained with a CVI that does not list each animal individually. 
Backtags on Slaughter Animals 
In the first paragraph of proposed revisions to Part 86, it states that cattle or bison may be moved 
through no more than one approved livestock marketing facility and then directly to a recognized 
slaughtering establishment. The language implies that the back tag may be applied at the 
recognized slaughtering establishment. We disagree with allowing cattle or bison moving 
through a livestock marketing facility to be back tagged at the recognized slaughtering facility. 
These animals should be back tagged at the approved livestock marketing facility before moving 
to slaughter. Any cattle or bison moving through a market should be tagged before there is any 
chance of commingling, loss of origin identity, or leaving the first market. BOAH still supports 
allowing tags to be applied at the slaughter facility for movements directly from the 
farm of 
origin to a recognized slaughtering facility without any commingling. 
Application of RFID 840 Tags 
BOAH supports the limitation in the current rule prohibiting application of more than one 
official identification device or method to an animal. BOAH supports the exception provided for 
the application of 840 prefix identification to animals already officially identified with a National 
Uniform Eartagging System (NEUS) tag. 9 CFR 86.3(c)(3). But, BOAH believes this exception 
should be broadened to allow the application of 840 prefix radio frequency identification (RFID) 
tag to an animal that is already identified with a non-RFID 840 prefix tag. A non-RFID tag is 
incompatible with a system that relies on RFID tags to function, such as wand or panel readers at 
markets and many dairy management systems. With more livestock markets embracing EID 
reader technology and more dairy farms using EID for cow management, the rule should 
accommodate a market or farmer's effort to improve technology in identification and data 
capture by allowing the application of an RFID tag. 
Thank you for considering these comments.

National Pork Producers Council’s Comments Regarding Docket No. APHIS–2014–0018: Livestock Marketing Facilities     The National Pork Producers Council (NPPC) is an association of 43 state pork producer organizations that serves as the voice in Washington for the nation’s pork producers.  The U.S. pork industry represents a significant value-added activity in the agriculture economy and the overall U.S. economy.  Nationwide more than 68,000 pork producers marketed more than 117 million hogs in 2013, and those animals provided total gross receipts of more than $23.4 billion.  Overall, an estimated $22.3 billion of personal income and $39 billion of gross national product are supported by the U.S. hog industry.  After careful review and input from subject-matter experts, NPPC submits the following comments regarding USDA APHIS’s proposed rule for Livestock Marketing Facilities.  It is our understanding that the intent of this rule is to update the regulations governing Livestock Marketing Facilities and to ensure the traceability of livestock that are moved in interstate commerce to and from such facilities.  In the Proposed Revisions to Part 86, USDA is proposing to define “farm of origin” in § 86.1 as ‘‘any farm where livestock are produced, or any farm on which they are maintained for at least 4 consecutive months prior to interstate movement.” If published as written, this definition would apply to all livestock covered under the ADT rule.   This proposed definition is in conflict with 9 CFR Part 85 Pseudorabies, Section § 85.1 of which defines “farm of origin” as “A farm where the swine were born, or on which they have resided for at least 90 consecutive days immediately prior to the interstate shipment.”   NPPC suggests that the Proposed Revision to Part 86 definition of “farm of origin” should include language that specifies it only applies to cattle and bison.  Alternatively, the proposed rule could provide a definitive statement that for swine the definition of “farm of origin” in 9 CFR Part 85 Pseudorabies, Section § 85.1 takes precedence over the definition of “farm of origin” in the rule.   Based on the interpretation of the Proposed Revisions to Part 86 related to the meanings of “No More than One” found in § 86.4 and ‘‘Directly To An Approved Livestock Marketing Facility’’ found in § 86.5, any revisions to clarify the intent of the meanings 

	  	  
published in a final rule would only apply to cattle and bison, and not to swine. NPPC requests that the USDA provide a definitive statement to that effect, in order to ensure that there are no unintended consequences to the pork industry related to consistency and continuity in the identification and movement of swine to livestock marketing facilities.  NPPC and the pork industry have worked diligently and cooperatively with USDA to develop and maintain a viable animal traceability that is consistent across the industry and states.  We are concerned that without appropriate corrections in the proposed rule there will be confusion as to how the rule applies to swine.    We appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule.  We will continue to work cooperatively with federal and state animal health authorities on implementing the program standards for the Swine ID plan, so the industry has a standardized animal identification and pre-harvest traceability system for animal health, commerce and trade that is consistent across all states.

When placed back by the hip if a cow is mounted prior to the glue drying the tag is often dislodged. Tags also stay much better in the spring when animals are sheading if a curry comb is used to remove loose hair prior to application.

Re: R-CALF USA Comments in Docket No. APHIS-2014-00 18, RIN 0579-AE02:  
Livestock Marketing Facilities:  Proposed Rule 
 
Dear Sir or Madam: 
  
The Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund, United St ockgrowers of America (R-CALF USA) 
appreciates this opportunity to submit comments to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) 
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) regarding the agency’s proposed rule: 
Livestock Marketing Facilities  (Proposed Rule), published at 80 Fed. Reg. 6-13 (J an. 2, 2015) 
and 80 Fed. Reg. 16,593-594 (March 30, 2015) (reopening of comment period). 
 
Among other things, the Proposed Rule would relax requirements under the regulations in 9 CFR 
part 86, “Animal Disease Traceability” (ADT) by no longer requiring an accredited veterinarian, 
State representative, or APHIS representative be on the premises of a livestock marketing facility 
on sale days and by allowing adult cattle and bison , under certain circumstances, to be moved 
interstate without an accompanying owner-shipper statement.  
 
R-CALF USA contends that the federally mandated ADT  represents government overreach, is 
unnecessarily intrusive, and its stated objectives would be better accomplished if left to 
individual states and tribes. Therefore, any relaxa tions of the ADT’s requirements are viewed by 
R-CALF USA as favorable improvements.  
 
It is noteworthy that R-CALF USA members are concer ned with the increasing scarcity of 
accredited large animal veterinarians across the na tion, which is symptomatic of our industry’s 
fast shrinking marketing outlets. This shrinkage is the result of the ongoing vertical integration of 
the U.S. cattle industry by oligopolistic meatpacke rs and is being facilitated by the Department 
of Justice’s and USDA’s inadequate enforcement of U .S. antitrust laws and the Packers and 
Stockyards Act. Consequently, there are now far few er cattle feeders, far fewer cow/calf 
producers and far fewer cattle than there were just  a decade or so ago. Hence, there are now 
fewer economic opportunities for large animal veterinarians.

R-CALF USA Comments Regarding Livestock Marketing Facilities 
April 15, 2015 
Page 2   
 
Perhaps this is the reason for the aforementioned p roposed relaxations of the ADT requirements. 
It appears the U.S. cattle industry has already shr unk to a level where it is no longer 
economically feasible to rely on the dwindling pool of available veterinarians.  
 
R-CALF USA recommends that APHIS relax an additiona l and related requirement under the 
ADT that, like the Proposed Rule, would reduce the need to rely on large animal veterinarians to 
perform a redundant service that the ADT now requires at livestock marketing facilities. 
 
Under current regulations, a group of adult cattle offloaded at a livestock marketing facility are 
required to be run through a chute to be individual ly identified and their official identification 
numbers individually recorded by the attending vete rinarian prior to sale if they did not already 
arrive with such accompanying documentation.  It is  common for individual cattle within such a 
group of cattle to be sold to more than one buyer a t the livestock marketing facility. Presently, 
before these same cattle that had already been identified and recorded as a group prior to entering 
the sale ring can be loaded for shipment to differe nt out-of-state destinations, they must again be 
run through a chute to have their individual identi fication numbers read and recorded, and the 
resulting new documentation then accompanies the cattle to their new destinations. 
 
The requirement that individual cattle identified a nd recorded in a group must be re-recorded on 
separate documents when the group is dispersed to d ifferent out-of-state destinations is an 
unnecessary burden on livestock marketing facilitie s and their attending large animal 
veterinarians. To remedy this, R-CALF USA recommend s that each group of cattle dispersed 
interstate from the original group should be allowe d to travel accompanied by a copy of the list 
of the original group’s identification numbers. 
 
For clarity, R-CALF USA proposes this:  If cattle w ith numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 arrive at the 
livestock marketing facility, the interstate certif icate of veterinary inspection (ICVI) will list 
numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4.  If each animal is then sold  to a different out-of-state buyer, then four 
copies of the original ICVI should be made and each  individual animal would then travel 
interstate accompanied by a copy of the original ICVI that includes all four animals.   
      
This streamlining of current paperwork requirements  will not interfere with interstate disease 
tracebacks. Instead, it will help to expedite any p otential disease investigation. This is because 
animal health officials, when reviewing the documen tation accompanying a potential disease 
suspect, will have immediate access not only to whe re the individual animal originated, but also, 
which other animals had left the same farm of origin at the same time as the suspect animal.   
 
R-CALF USA encourages APHIS to adopt this recommend ed change when it promulgates its 
final rule as doing so will eliminate unnecessary b urdens on livestock marketing facilities and 
their attending large animal veterinarians and will help to expedite potential disease tracebacks. 
 
Sincerely,

Re: Docket No. FDA-2014-N-2294, Evaluation of FDA’s Multicultural Youth Tobacco Prevention Campaigns 
 
To Whom It May Concern:  
 
The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (FSPTCA) gives the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
broad regulatory authority over the manufacture, sale, and marketing of tobacco products.  One of the fundamental 
purposes of the FSPTCA is to prevent underage smoking initiation, and one of the essential purposes of the Act is to 
reduce “the number of children and adolescents who use cigarettes and smokeless tobacco and [to] prevent [] the life-
threatening health consequences associated with tobacco use.” Sec. 2(31).  In association with its regulatory efforts, FDA 
is developing and implementing a public education campaign aimed at preventing tobacco use among multicultural youth.  
This effort will help reduce the tremendous toll that tobacco takes on our nation’s health and on particular populations.   
 
The media tracking survey and the outcome evaluation study proposed by FDA are critical to FDA’s efforts to develop 
and implement an effective multicultural youth tobacco prevention campaign.  Media tracking and evaluation studies are 
important public health tools and are used regularly to assess and improve public education campaigns, and the methods 
proposed are standard ones.  The results will inform FDA efforts both during the campaign and for potential subsequent 
campaigns. 
The aims of the media tracking survey and the outcome evaluation study for which FDA seeks approval are to monitor 
awareness of and receptivity to campaign messages among the intended audience and to assess changes in tobacco-related 
knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and behavior.  It is essential that FDA have the information collected as part of these 
evaluations to ensure that the target population is being reached with effective campaign messages.  Results from these 
evaluations will allow FDA to optimize the design and delivery of messages for the target population as well as document 
the effectiveness of the campaign, including the influence of different media channels and messages on changing tobacco-
related knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and behavior. 
We urge OMB to approve FDA’s request for data collection, so that FDA is able to assure that its campaign messages will 
effectively reach the target audience and have their intended effect.

Re: Comment Letter on Proposed Housing Improvement Program Regulation Amendments 
Dear Ms. Appel: 
Please accept this letter on behalf of the South Dakota Native Homeownership Coalition 
(Coalition). Created in 2013, the Coalition is a collaborative group of key agencies with a 
mission to increase homeownership opportunities for South Dakota's Native peop le to build 
strong and healthy communities. Our stakeholders include approximately 75 representatives of 
South Dakota's tribes, federal and state agencies, the South Dakota's Governor's Office, tribally

community development financial institutions (CDFis). 
We are pleased to submit this comment letter in strong support of the proposed expansion of 
the Bureau of Indian Affairs' Housing Improvement Program (HIP} to include a down payment 
assistance program. According to a recent survey of stakeholders promoting Native 
homeownership conducted by the Coalition, 70 percent of respondents said that one of the 
biggest hurdles to homeownership in Native communities in South Dakota is the homebuyer 
readiness of clients. Some of the key ways identified by the survey respondents to prepare 
homeowners is to provide credit counseling, financial education, homebuyer education, and 
access to down payment and closing costs assistance. The Coalition is working hard to address

        Bureau of Indian Affairs 
        Docket ID:  BIA-2014-0004
Dear Elizabeth K. Appel,
On behalf of the Jamestown S’Klallam Tribe, I am pleased to respond to your request 
for comments on the proposed rule published by the Department of Interior that would 
revise current regulations at 25 CFR 256, Housing Improvement Program.  The 
Jamestown S’Klallam Tribe (the “Tribe”) is a federally recognized Tribe whose lands are 
located on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State.  Our Tribe seeks to be self -
sufficient and provide quality governmental programs and services that address the 
unique social, cultural, natural resource and economic needs of its citizens.  
Our Tribe operates a BIA Housing Improvement Program under 25 CFR 256, to assist 
needy Tribal citizens and Indian families living within our Tribal service area who have 
no other recourse for decent, safe and sanitary housing.  The proposed rule would 
update various provisions that will align the HIP Program with other Federal program 
income requirements, provide flexibility for Tribes to better address large waiting lists in 
their service areas, foster relationships with other Federal agencies on ways to leverage 
Federal housing funds, improve sustainable affordable housing on Tribal lands, 
Increase the number of Tribal citizens/ Indian families served and, increase the number 
of projects funded. We therefore appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on this 
matter.


Comments on Proposed Rule Revising 25 CFR 256
Housing Improvement Program
March 6, 2015 Page 2
General Comments: 
Category A – Repair of Existing Homes
 The proposed rule would increase the limit for Category A Funding from $2,500 
to $7,500.  We are in favor of the proposed increase to the funding limits as it 
would allow us to address more housing conditions that threaten the health 
and/or safety of our Tribal citizens/Indian families that reside in our service area.  
The current repair limits are inadequate because they do not reflect the average 
costs of housing repairs.   
Category B – Renovation Limits
 The proposed rule would increase the limit for Category B Funding from $35,000 
to $60,000 and Increase the Payback Agreement period from 5 years to 10 
years.  We are in favor of the proposed increase to the renovation limits as it 
would allow us to comply with applicable Tribal building code standards.  The 
current renovation limits are inadequate because they fail to provide adequate 
funding to improve housing conditions to a level that meets applicable building 
code standards.  We are also in favor of increasing the Payback Agreement 
period due to the fact that we will be investing almost twice as much money for 
home renovations and want to ensure that we will recoup the entire amount of 
funds invested or a portion thereof if the recipient sells the home.  The money we 
recoup could be used to address the housing needs of other HIP program 
applicants on our current waiting list.
Category D – Down Payment Assistance
 We are in favor of the new provision, Category D – Down Payment Assistance, 
which would allow us to leverage USDA Direct Loans and HUD Section 184 
Loans.  If we are able to leverage federal dollars from these other housing loan 
programs, we will be able to serve Tribal citizens/Indian families who would not 
otherwise qualify for housing because they do not have the financial resources to 
come up with a down payment.  Our working class Tribal members use their 
limited income for essential needs and cannot afford to save enough money to 
move into permanent housing.  Down payment assistance dollars could be used 
to buy down the interest rate and principle loan so that monthly mortgage 
payments are affordable for working Tribal families.",0,0

new	  category	  will	  demand	  more	  of	  the	  HIP’s	  time	  and	  resources;	  the	  program	  will	  probably	  need	  to	  allocate	  new	  staff	  members,	  new	  forms	  will	  need	  to	  be	  constructed	  and	  new	  procedures	  will	  need	  to	  be	  in	  place.	  Positioning	  down	  payment	  assistance	  under	  the	  general	  theme	  of	  “housing	  needs”	  of	  C-­‐2	  will	  prevent	  loss	  of	  time,	  energy	  and	  resources.	  	  	  	   HIP’s	  priority	  ranking	  is	  based	  on	  total	  numeric	  value	  established	  by	  points	  under	  the	  ranking	  factor.	  Within	  this	  ranking	  factor,	  each	  dependent	  receives	  three	  points,	  and	  families	  that	  encompass	  disabled	  persons	  or	  elderly	  get	  extra	  points	  added	  to	  their	  priority	  ranking.	  Of	  course	  taking	  disability	  and	  elderly	  age	  under	  consideration	  is	  justified.	  However,	  I	  do	  not	  see	  any	  priority	  points	  being	  granted	  to	  families	  with	  young	  children.	  Shouldn’t	  families	  in	  extreme	  need	  with	  children	  receive	  priority	  in	  ranking	  factors?	  Having	  homes	  or	  resources	  available	  for	  these	  families	  with	  children	  should	  be	  prioritized	  above	  all.	  It	  is	  our	  duty	  as	  society	  to	  allocate	  sufficient	  and	  necessary	  resources	  to	  these	  children	  for	  their	  protection	  and	  nourishment.	  Having	  a	  comfortable	  home	  is	  crucial	  to	  a	  child’s	  development;	  the	  lack	  of	  habitable	  homes	  will	  most	  likely	  position	  these	  children	  at	  a	  life	  long	  disadvantage.	  	  	  	   With	  this	  new	  revision,	  the	  applicant	  after	  applying	  to	  the	  program	  stays	  in	  the	  pool	  of	  prospective	  recipients	  for	  four	  years.	  This	  is	  neither	  advantageous	  to	  the	  applicant	  nor	  to	  the	  purpose	  of	  HIP.	  Having	  the	  ability	  to	  apply	  each	  year	  allows	  applicants	  to	  be	  current	  with	  the	  information	  that	  they	  provide	  regarding	  their	  financial	  status	  and	  overall	  needs.	  When	  the	  program	  finally	  reaches	  to	  an	  application	  filed	  four	  years	  prior,	  the	  applicant’s	  circumstances	  might	  be	  completely	  different	  than	  the	  time	  of	  applying.	  The	  resources	  that	  an	  applicant	  might	  need	  at	  the	  time	  the	  program	  gets	  to	  their	  application	  may	  not	  be	  reflected	  by	  the	  completed	  application	  at	  hand.	  	  Furthermore,	  having	  an	  annual	  update	  option	  will	  give	  rise	  to	  many	  technical	  issues	  that	  will	  burden	  the	  applicant’s	  chances	  of	  ever	  receiving	  the	  help.	  For	  instance,	  fleeting	  memory	  of	  the	  content	  of	  the	  original	  filing	  will	  prevent	  families	  from	  accurately	  updating	  their	  applications,	  which	  will	  have	  a	  direct	  effect	  to	  the	  increase	  of	  the	  chances	  of	  inconsistency	  in	  the	  applicant’s	  original	  filing	  and	  the	  yearly	  updates.	  This,	  in	  turn,	  will	  burden	  the	  applicant’s	  chances	  of	  receiving	  help	  in	  a	  timely	  fashion.	  	  Having	  families	  file	  every	  year	  will	  keep	  the	  application	  process	  current	  and	  consistent	  across	  the	  board	  without	  any	  extra	  dealings.	  	  	  Under	  section	  two,	  the	  subtitle	  “Other	  Changes”	  states	  that	  the	  proposed	  rule	  will	  make	  other	  revisions	  to	  update	  past	  application	  issues	  and	  better	  reflect	  current	  housing	  needs.	  	  The	  paragraph	  continues	  to	  explain	  two	  major	  proposed	  changes	  discussed	  early	  on	  under	  section	  two.	  These	  are	  HIP	  assisting	  extremely	  in	  need	  families	  (increasing

 subtitle	  of	  this	  paragraph	  is	  “Other	  Changes,”	  the	  content	  does	  not	  elaborate	  what	  these	  “other	  changes”	  may	  be,	  except	  reinstating

Re: Comments of the United South and Eastern Tribes, Inc. on the proposed rule revising 25 CFR Part 256, 
Housing Improvement Program 1076-AF22, Docket ID: BIA-2014-0004 
 
 
Dear Ms. Appel, 
 
The United South and Eastern Tribes, Inc. (USET) is pleased to provide the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA or “the 
Bureau”) with the following comments on the Proposed Rule that would revise current regulations at 25 CFR Part 
256, Housing Improvement Program (HIP). 
 
USET is a non-profit, inter-Tribal organization representing 26 federally recognized Indian Tribes from Texas 
across to Florida and up to Maine.1  USET is dedicated to enhancing the development of Tribal nations, to 
improving the capabilities of Tribal governments, and assisting USET Member Tribes in dealing effectively with 
public policy issues and in serving the broad needs of Indian people. 
 
Given the important role that the HIP plays in addressing the unmet housing needs of low-income American 
Indians, USET is pleased that the Bureau recognizes the need for updates and improvements to the program. 
However, we have concerns related to a number of the proposed changes, especially in light of the HIP’s limited 
appropriation. In addition, we note that the Proposed Rule does not address the HIP’s funding formula 
methodology, which does not currently function well for USET Tribes. 
 
Need for Additional HIP Appropriations 
Unlike many other line items in the BIA budget, appropriations for the HIP have been declining. In 2006, the HIP 
appropriation was $22.6 million, but since then, it has steadily decreased and is currently funded at $8.009 million 
for Fiscal Year (FY) 2015. The President’s FY 2016 Budget Request contains only a $12,000 increase for the 
                                                           
1 USET member Tribes include:  Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas, Aroostook Band of Micmac Indians of Maine, Catawba Indian 
Nation of South Carolina, Cayuga Nation of New York, Chitimacha Tribe of Louisiana, Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana, Eastern Band of 
Cherokee Indians of North Carolina, Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians of Maine, Jena Band of Choctaw Indians of Louisiana, 
Mashantucket Pequot Indian Tribe of Connecticut, Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe of Massachusetts, Miccosukee Tribe of Florida, 
Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, Mohegan Tribe of Connecticut, Narragansett Indian Tribe of Rhode Island, Oneida Nation of New 
York, Passamaquoddy Tribe at Indian Township of Maine, Passamaquoddy Tribe at Pleasant Point of Maine, Penobscot Indian Nation of 
Maine, Poarch Band of Creek Indians of Alabama, Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe of New York, Seminole Tribe of Florida, Seneca Nation of 
New York, Shinnecock Indian Nation of New York, Tunica-Biloxi Tribe of Louisiana, and the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah) 
of Massachusetts.   

 
 
 
 
 
program. Yet, in its report on the HIP for 2014, the Bureau acknowledges that it was only able to serve 99 out of 
7,032 eligible applicants nationwide. In order to responsibly implement many changes in the proposed rule, USET 
urges the Bureau and this Administration to request a much more substantial appropriation for the HIP.  
 
Categories of Assistance Funding Limit Increases 
In concept, USET is highly in favor of the proposed increases to funding limitations for housing needs Categories 
A and B. We agree that the current monetary limits on these categories do not accurately reflect the average 
costs of repair and renovation. This is particularly true in BIA’s Eastern Region, where the average cost of living, 
including costs related to housing renovation and construction, is higher than that of many other Regions. 
However, increasing the funding limits for these categories in the absence of significant additional appropriations 
is unwise. Unless the Administration and Congress work together to fund the HIP at meaningful level, increasing 
funding limits may serve to limit the number of approved HIP applications.  
 
Category D 
Similarly, USET supports the addition of Category D, which would provide for down payment assistance. This new 
category will further assist in serving the goals of the HIP—to provide adequate housing for eligible low-income 
American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). In its proposed form, however, Category D is lacking spending 
caps and other safeguards that current HIP assistance categories possess. For instance, the proposed category 
has no cap on the amount of funding that may be awarded. Without a cap, the limited appropriation that the HIP 
receives may be distributed to a much smaller number of recipients. In addition, while each of the other categories 
of assistance provide for payback agreements, should the recipient be foreclosed upon or sell the property, the 
new Category D does not. Finally, eligibility for Category D carries with it a 30 point value in Ranking Factor 
(factor #6: Applicants with an Approved Financing Package). This could lead to an approval bias toward Category 
D applications while needs related to the other three categories continue to go unmet. 
 
Without some modest limitations, Category D has the potential to consume a large portion of the HIP 
appropriation, as well as facilitate the misuse of funds. In order to preserve the integrity of the HIP, USET urges 
the Bureau to incorporate award limits and payback agreements into the requirements for Category D. Award 
limits should reflect housing costs within a given Region, but balance this assistance with the need for funding for 
the other categories. Any funds that are received via payback agreements should be returned to the Tribe, Tribally 
Designated Housing Entity (TDHE), or Tribal organization directly operating the HIP Program or the BIA, so that 
they can serve other eligible applicants. The Bureau should further consider reducing the 30 point value for an 
approved financing application. 
 
Payback Agreements and Self-Governance 
The current procedures for payback agreements are not consistent with the principles of Tribal self-governance 
under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA) and the Native American Housing 
Assistance and Self-Determination Act (NAHASDA). In the event of home sale or foreclosure, HIP funds should 
be returned to the Tribe, TDHE, or Tribal organization directly operating the HIP Program or the BIA, rather than 
solely the BIA. This change would then allow for the HIP funding to stay directly within the community where it 
was originally invested, consistent with the intent of ISDEAA, NAHASDA, and the self-governance movement. 
Otherwise, a return of funding to the BIA could result in unnecessary delay, red-tape, and/or return to the Treasury 
and out of the realm of meeting Tribal housing needs. 
 
Ranking Factor Rule Changes 
Of the changes to the rules associated with the four current Ranking Factors, USET is strongly supportive of the 
increase in income guidelines. With the high cost of living in the Eastern Region comes an increase in income that 
currently prevents many low income AI/ANs from accessing the HIP. While the Federal Poverty Level (FPL)",0,0
2014-30692,BIA-2014-0004-0011,"March 6, 2015 <br/><br/>VIA ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION<br/>Bureau of Indian Affairs <br/>Attn:<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Elizabeth Appel, Director, Office of Regulatory Affairs &amp; Collaborative Action<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Subject:<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Comments on Proposed Amendments to Housing Improvement Program, Docket Nos. BIA-2014-0004<br/><br/>My name is Christina Sturdevant and I am a first year law student in California.  <br/><br/>First, the proposed amendment to the Housing Improvement Program that will increase the income guidelines fits squarely within the Bureau of Indian Affairs mission.  The Bureau of Indian Affairs mission is to enhance the quality of life, promote economic opportunity, and to carry out the responsibility to protect and improve the trust assets of American Indians, Indian tribes, and Alaska Natives. If the income guidelines are increased from 125 percent to 150 percent of the federal poverty level, more American Indian and Alaska Native families will be eligible for the housing improvement grants.  Individuals living at 150 percent of the federal poverty level, while slightly more advantaged than those living at 125 percent of the poverty level, still require adequate housing conditions.  The increase of 25 percent will allow families who do not have financial resources to repair or renovate their existing homes.<br/><br/>Second, the Act should be amended to increase the monetary limit of funding granted to Category A and Category B recipients.  Category A and Category B recipients currently receive a maximum of $2,500 to repair or renovate their homes.  As stated in the proposal, this amount is inadequate to create material changes to the existing homes of impoverished families.  Of course, any funding creates a dent, but $2,500 is unlikely to make any lasting improvements.  For example, re-carpeting a small apartment costs at least $1,000.  Surely, the Bureau of Indian Affairs mission to enhance the quality of life of American Indians, Indian tribes, and Alaska Natives is only minimally carried out by such a small repair.  While an apartment may be re-carpeted, there might be termite damage (several thousands of dollars to repair), water damage, and any host of costly repairs that need fixing.  A grant of merely $2,500 simply is not enough to truly enhance the quality of life of these families.  Further, these amendments will advance the requirements of 25 U.S.C.  13, which state that, the Bureau of Indian affairs use money appropriated to them by Congress to assist in the relief of distress and conservation of health of Indians throughout the United States.  This proposed amendment would improve the health of impoverished Native American families by improving basic needs.  For example, water damage can lead to mold, bed bugs can lead to a host of health issues and unfit housing conditions contribute to a host of mental illnesses.  Therefore, the act should be amended to reflect the proposal of an increase from $2,500 to $7,500.<br/><br/>Finally, the proposal to amend the payback period for Category B grant recipients from five years to ten years should not be implemented because it is coercive and places an undue burden on recipients of the grants. Payback agreements require recipients to pay back the entire amount of funding received or a portion thereof if the recipient sell a home repaired or renovated with grant money within a certain period of time. Currently, that period of time is set at five years.  The proposal is to amend that period to ten years.  This increase will detrimentally affect the life opportunities of grant recipients because they will be constrained by the requirement that they stay in their home for at least ten years.  This will greatly impair the abilities of families who may in the future decide to seek job opportunities far from home.  Of course, part of the Bureau of Indian Affairs mission is to increase the economic opportunities of Native American, and Alaska Native families.  The requirement that families who took advantage of the opportunity to improve their homes, and better their lives, will limit their economic opportunities long term.  For example, it is conceivable that five years from repairing ones home, a grant recipient who has been unable to find employment learns about greater job opportunities in another locality or state.  This individual will be constrained by the requirement not to sell their home because they will have to pay back the amount of funding they received five years prior.  While the individual will have a home that is hospitable, he or she will not also have the resources that come with a recurring paycheck.  Therefore, the proposed amendment to the Category B payback period is an impediment to future economic opportunities of grant recipients and should not be implemented.<br/><br/>Respectfully submitted,<br/><br/>Christina Sturdevant <br/> <br/><br/>",2015-03-12T04:00:00Z,2015-03-05T20:10:54Z,,,,,,,,,,,,false,0,,,0,0

Re: Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Proposed Rule for the Housing Improvement Program 
(HIP) 
Dear Ms. Appel, 
On behalf of the Maniilaq Association, headquartered in Kotzebue, Alaska, we submit 
comments on the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Proposed Rule for the Housing Improvement 
Program (HIP). The Maniilaq Association, is a regional tribal organization representing 12 
federally recognized tribes in northwest Alaska, including: the Native Village of Ambler, Native 
Village of Buckland, Native Village of Deering, Native Village ofKiana, Native Village of 
Kivalina, Native Village of Kobuk, Native Village ofKotzebue, Native Village ofNoatak, 
Noorvik Native Community, Native Village of Point Hope, Native Village of Selawik, and 
Native Village of Shungnak. 
The Maniilaq Association supports the value of the HIP program, but also challenges the 
Department of Interior (DOl) and the BIA to work with Congress to fund the program at a 
meaningful level that can actually meet existing needs in Indian Country and for Alaska Natives. 
We support the BIA's overall intent in the Proposed Rule to provide greater flexibility in the 
implementation of the HIP, more effective priorities for funding, higher limits for allowable 
costs (including freight costs for materials, which is a significant issue in Alaska), and longer 
active period for pending applications, among other developments. As noted in the comments 
below, however, we also have recommendations for further improvements for the Proposed 
Rule. 
• §256.7 ofthe Proposed Rule and Increase in Amounts: 
• The increase in amounts for Category A funding for interim improvement assistance up 
to $7500 (from the previous $2500) is an appropriate and positive change, particularly 
with the explicit allowance of freight costs. We recommend, though, that the BIA revisit 
this amount within 2-3 years, rather than the lengthy time that lapsed prior to the 
Proposed Rule, to make certain this amount continues to be sufficient, particularly in 
Alaska.

• The increase in amounts for Category B funding for renovation assistance up to 
$60,000 (from the previous $35,000) is an appropriate and positive change, particularly 
with the explicit allowance of freight costs. We recommend, though, that the BIA revisit 
this amount within 2-3 years, rather than the lengthy time that lapsed prior to the 
Proposed Rule, to make certain this amount continues to be sufficient, particularly in 
Alaska. 
• The inclusion of allowable freight costs in Alaska to Category C funding is a welcome 
change. 
• The addition of a new category of down payment assistance as Category D is another 
welcome addition to the HIP program, though we recommend that the definition of 
""standard housing condition"" in§ 256.2(1) should state that construction conforms to 
codes ""and/or to appropriate building standards for the region where no such codes 
exist."" We note that in rural Alaska, and·the Maniilaq region in particular, there are 
circumstances where building codes do not always match up, or keep pace with best 
practices in building standards. Adding the above underlined language would 
acknowledge this regional difference. 
• §256.9-Category B Assistance. 
We recommend that §256.9(d)(2) be revised to be consistent with the Indian Self­
Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA), 
1 
and practice of self-governance by 
many tribes and tribal organizations operating the HIP program. That revision would read as 
follows: 
""At the time of settlement of the sale of the house, you will repay the tribe, or tribal 
organization directly operating the HIP Program or the BIA the full cost of all 
renovations made under this part."" 
This change would then allow for the HIP funding, if it is returned in the 1 0 years following 
completion of repairs and renovation, to stay directly within the community where it was 
originally invested, consistent with the intent of ISDEAA and the self-governance movement. 
Otherwise, a return of funding to the BIA could result in unnecessary delay, red-tape, and/or 
return to the Treasury and out of the realm of meeting tribal housing needs. 
• §256.1 O-Cate gory C Assistance. 
We recommend that §256.10(b)(2) be revised to be consistent with the ISDEAA, and 
practice of self-governance by many tribes, and tribal organizations operating the HIP program.

Re: Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Proposed Rule for the Housing Improvement Program 
(HIP) 
Dear Ms. Appel: 
These comments, on the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Proposed Rule for the Housing 
Improvement Program (HIP), are submitted by the Spokane Indian Housing Authority, located 
on the Spokane Reservation in Eastern Washington State. 
First, and probably most important, the Spokane Indian Housing Authority joins with 
other tribes/TDHEs/tribal organizations to urge BIA and the Administration to seek a significant 
increase in appropriations to fund HIP and to increase the focus in the BIA on this program. HIP 
rightly targets a part of the population that is in dire need of such support. HIP has had a 
significant impact in the lives of Indian people, but over the years the amount of funding in real 
dollars has dropped substantially. The result has been to limit the effectiveness of the program. 
As you know, there have been a great deal of news coverage lately about the importance of 
""housing first"" in addressing a variety of social ills - unemployment, crime, drug and alcohol 
abuse-that we see in Indian Country. HIP has the potential to ensure that some of the lowest 
income Indian families can maintain their homes and avoid homelessness or overcrowding, but 
to reach that potential it must be funded at a sufficient level. 
We join with other tribes/TDHEs/tribal organizations in supporting the value of the HIP 
program, the Department of Interior (DOl) and the BIA to work with Congress to fund the 
program at a meaningful level that can actually meet existing needs in Indian Country. The 
Spokane Indian Housing Authority supports the BIA's overall intent in the Proposed Rule to 
provide greater flexibility in the implementation of the HIP, more effective priorities for funding, 
higher limits for allowable costs, and longer active period for pending applications, among other 
developments. As noted in the comments below, however, the Spokane Indian Housing 
Authority also has recommendations for further improvements for the Proposed Rule.

!!AGENCY: US Department of Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) 
ACTION: Proposed rule. 
DATE POSTED: January 2, 2015 
CLOSE DATE: March 6, 2015 
SUBJECT: Housing Improvement Program  
! In accordance to the Federal requirements, the proposed rule increases the number of 
Indians’ families that could accede to housing funds for repairing (A), renovating (B) or 
replacing (C) existing housing and for providing (D) new housing. Specifically, it is an 
amendment to the Housing Improvement Program (HIP).This safety-net program is based on a 
priority ranking that identifies individuals and families most in need of housing assistance, 
among the eligible members of federally recognized Indian tribes.  
 Actually, I am an International law student of the Nova Southeastern University just for a 
semester. The majority of my legal interests and of successful exams is on international field; 
therefore my final Thesis in Romatre University will concern exactly the international matter. 
Here, in the United States, I am part of a minority group, the italians.  
In general, even when I was in my native land, I have always struggled for the recognition and 
the development of the minority groups. Mostly of my interest is focused on people with 
disabilities; specifically, I participated to several open meetings of the ANIEP, an italian non 
profit association, and of my territorial church. For these reasons I am strongly interested on the 
rule proposed by BIA, which defends and promotes a minority group’s right.  

 In particular, the proposed rule would add, to the four existing categories of housing 
needs (A,B,C and D), a new one for the down-payment assistance. Furthermore, it would also 
increase the limits for the categories A and B.  
Analyzing the actual distribution of the funds, it is based on ranking factors; these factors are the 
Annual Household income, the age requirement, the disabilities and the family size. The 
proposing rule would add new factors for homelessness, overcrowding, and dilapidated housing.  
The Bureau of Indian Affair would also lengthen the payback period of Category B (from five to 
ten years) and the time for consideration of an application (from one to four years).  
It would better satisfy requirements of the  American with Disabilities Act (ADA) by increasing 
the square-footage limits of the house. 
The changes would also allow the applicant to provide proof of homesite even by lease, rather 
than requiring ownership.  
Finally, it would allow for HIP assistance to families with a very low income, rather than just 
families with extremely  low income.  
 Throughout the development of the proposed rule, the Bureau of Indian Affairs had held 
several listing sessions with representatives of federally recognized Indian tribes. Indian tribes 
indicated that the actual program does not satisfy the indian members’ needs. They expressly 
declared that structure of the system does not allow them to make progress on the waiting lists of 
member with housing needs. Therefore, the proposed rule is the result of several listenings, 
consultation and dialogue between the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian Tribes. 
The preservation and the development of the member of Indian tribes are very important in the 
United States. Indeed the indian tribes, even if represent a minority part of the population, are",0,0

The down payment assistance funds will help Native American families qualify for homeownership financing.  Since this is a new category and expands the allowable HIP Programs housing assistance funds and services there should be clarification that these funds may be used for: down payment assistance, closing costs, education in financial literacy and homebuyer education and counseling. <br/>o<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Income Eligibility for Category D In order to insure that the HIP down payment assistance is available to families who can afford mortgage financing, we recommend that income eligibility be defined for Category D by using the definition provided by the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act (NAHASDA) regulations.  This would allow eligibility by participants with annual income that is 80 percent of the area median income or United States median income, whichever is higher.  (12 CFR 1000.10)  <br/><br/>o<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Previous Assistance While we recognize the need to serve clients who have not previously received assistance through the HIP program, we recommend that the restriction from being eligible for the HIP down payment program not apply to recipients of Category B rehabilitation funds if the funds were received prior to a certain time, e.g. more than 25 years ago (proposed Section 256.6 (g)).<br/><br/>o<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Set-Aside In order to promote the use of the down payment assistance program, we recommend that 10 percent of each Regions HIP allocation be set-aside for Category D.  If the funds are not expended by the end of the fiscal year, they could be reprogrammed for other HIP categories.  It is important to document need for Category D so future appropriation requests can be increased to meet the need to assist Native American families with down payment assistance. <br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Ranking Factors I support adding the new ranking factors of homelessness, overcrowding, and dilapidated housing will help identify the housing needs of the poorest of the poor.  As the need for safe, sanitary and affordable housing increases it is very important to document the need (funded and unfunded) for all categories so future appropriation requests can be increased to provide adequate allocations to Tribes, especially those who have the highest poverty conditions, address their housing shortage. <br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Advisory Committee for Handbook  I recommend that  the Bureau to create an Advisory Committee made up of representatives from Tribes, TDHEs, current HIP Directors, Native CDFIs, and other lenders to provide input during the development of the HIP Handbook that will provide guidance for HIP implementation. <br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Participation in Federal Government-Sponsored Housing The restriction against acquiring your present housing through participation in a Federal government-sponsored housing program (proposed Section 256.6 (h)) should deleted because it is unclear and could possibly unnecessarily limit participation.  For example, would an applicant be eligible if he or she obtained their home through a Mutual Help or rent-to-own program, HUD Section 184, or RD Section 502?  We dont think participation in any of these programs should restrict participation in HIP, especially Category D. <br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the Housing Improvement Programs proposed program regulation amendments.  It is encouraging to see proposed changes that will have a positive impact on the eligible Native American families.

which started in 1979, and I met  many people who remembered their reservation lives.
My suggestion is called ""The Modular Utility Housing Insert Plan"".... I have sent this suggestion to the
Navajo Housing program but not sure if they ever tried it but here are the basics:
1.  Build a Utility Box  that can attached to an existing house that has no utility options or
     it can be inserted into a new house being built.
2.  It would be a wood and metal framed ""module"" that would include basic plumbing, electricity and
     heating options that could be built by a contractor or at a factory.
3. Plumbing would include pipes that would bring water into the house and distribute them to sinks,
     water faucets and toilets if needed.  
4. Electrical wiring option would bring in wiring for lights, electrical outlets and fans and heaters.
5.  On the Navajo reservation because there is very little electrical power lines coming to homes, this
     module could be powered by solar panels that store electrical power in batteries and then it could
     come into the house.  The solar panels would be installed either on the roof or on solar frames outside.
  6. One design feature would be that on one end of the 8 to 10 foot long utility module there could be 
     a doorway so that people could check and repair problems inside the module if needed.
 7. The Modular Rectangle should be 8 to 10 ft long and at least 6 ft wide so that things like small water
      heaters could be placed inside....but if appliances are not needed inside then the Utility Box would 
      only have to be 4 ft wide but it would still be ""crowded with pipes and wiring.
  
 After visiting Indian housing in South Dakota and New Mexico and Arizona, I became convinced that a plan
that would help many people with a design that could be created in large numbers and then passed on to 
Indian housing to improve their homes and their lives. 
Since this is being sent via email, I can't include a design ""picture"" but again if people believe that a Utility
Box would help improve Native American housing, then a professional might set up a formal design.
If more information or more suggestions would be helpful, please reply to this email
Thank you for trying to improve Indian housing around the country.

proposed rule changes for HIP and let me know that the comment period was ending today. 
On Wednesday, I received the following comments from the Jon Warner, Housing Director for the Confederated

and maybe email; so I am going to submit them both way.  Thanks 
I also, received the following comment verbally from Brian Thomas, Tribal Councilman for Duck Valley
Shoshone­Paiute Tribe, he requested that I send it in for him:
He believes we should have an additional Factor for Veterans should be added 20pts, that Disability remain the
proposed flat point but be 20pts not 10pts, and that Age should have a maximum of 20pts not 15pts.
I hope this is an acceptable means of submittal.  Thanks for all your help.

Thanks for the excellent training yesterday in Elko.
Melissa and I have been talking about the changes being considered and would like to
share our thoughts.
We have concerns about the change in the age requirement and the disability requirement.
As far as the age goes elderly persons between 55 and 62 and above 77 get either no
points or no additional points. I believe that is an excessive reduction in point consideration.
We would recommend that the age stay at 55 to start point consideration with a maximum of
20 points not 15. Any one above 75 would get 20 points which does not overly consider the
elderly.

The disabled should get more consideration. 10 points are not enough.
We have no comments regarding the income and the points for children is a good change
allowing for more points for larger families.

Dear BOEM Officials: 
Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the Environmental Assessment (EA) for the 
Virginia Offshore Wind Technology Project (VOWTAP). While I support Dominion's two test 
turbine project, such development must be done in a way that ensures robust protections 
for marine mammals and sea turtles, in particular for the North American right whale 
(NARW).  
In order to support a Finding of No Significant Issues (FONSI), BOEM must amend the 
final EA to include the following measures: 
 prohibit pile-driving during the NARWs peak migratory season from Nov. 1 to April 
30 
 during that time, place a uniform 10-knot speed limit restriction on all vessels of any 
length affiliated with the VOWTAP project 
 provide for a minimum of four qualified observers located at the pile driving site 
 require the developer to use the best commercially available technology to reduce 
noise associated with construction of the VOWTAP project 
I applaud BOEM's efforts to bring clean renewable offshore wind power online as soon as 
possible. The crisis we face with climate change demands it. We in Virginia are especially 
vulnerable to its impacts with our Hampton Roads area being second only to New Orleans 
in its vulnerability to sea level rise. 
From the VOWTAP project, critical information and ""lessons learned"" can be gleaned that 
can facilitate Dominion's timely build-out of its adjacent commercial lease area. We urge 
BOEM to work closely with Dominion and other project developers to facilitate build-out of 
the commercial lease area as soon as practicable, getting a substantial amount of wind 
power in operation no later than 2020.  
Finally, offshore wind development can provide a valuable compliance tool in meeting 
Virginia's obligations under the EPA's Clean Power Plan - assuming it comes on line in a 
timely manner.  
Thank you again for this opportunity to comment. 
Sincerely,

RE:  Virginia Offshore Wind Technology Advancement Project on the Atlantic Outer  
         Continental Shelf Offshore Virginia Environmental Assessment 
 
Dear Ms. Morin,  
 
We are writing this letter as marine science professionals from the Virginia Aquarium & Marine 
Science Center Foundation (VAQF), Research & Conservation Division. To be clear, the following 
comments are the opinions of the signers of this letter, and do not reflect the organizational opinion of 
VAQF.   
The mission of the Virginia Aquarium is to inspire conservation of the marine environment 
through education, research and sustainable practices. The VAQF Research & Conservation Division is 
responsible for directing many of the organization’s efforts in these areas and is dedicated to 
conservation through marine animal stranding response, research, rehabilitation and education. VAQF 
currently coordinates sea turtle and marine mammal stranding response for the state of Virginia. From 
2001 to 2010, our organization responded to a total of 950 marine mammal and over 1500 sea turtle 
strandings. As part of our stranding response efforts, we have collected over 20 years of data related to 
marine species presence, health, and anthropogenic risk in Virginia.  In addition to stranding response, 
VAQF has received federal, state, and private funding for a variety of research projects in Chesapeake 
Bay and coastal mid-Atlantic waters. Over the past decade, VAQF has conducted research on sea turtles 


VAQF Comments Page 2 
 
and marine mammals utilizing boat-based and aerial surveys, photo identification and biopsy sampling, 
satellite telemetry tagging, and health assessment studies. In addition, VAQF has researched fishery by-
catch and gear modifications, developed education and outreach programs, and conducted a vessel 
behavior characterization study.   
The intent of this letter is to provide comments related to the Bureau of Ocean Energy 
Management (BOEM) publication of the “Virginia Offshore Wind Technology Advancement Project on 
the Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf Offshore Virginia Environmental Assessment (OCS EIS/EA BOEM 
2014-1000)” (hereafter referred to as the EA). The VAQF is supportive of the development of offshore 
wind energy in Virginia waters and we are enthusiastic about being involved in the Wind Energy Area 
(WEA) National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process.  
We are focusing our comments on the effects of the proposed actions to marine mammals and 
sea turtles in the waters off the coast of Virginia. We agree with the EA’s conclusion that, “The impacts 
to marine mammals and sea turtles as a result of construction, operation and decommissioning activities 
related to the Proposed Action are anticipated to be negligible to moderate” (EA Section 3.2.6).  We 
would like to address the need to coordinate all parts of the WEA development process and wish to 
contribute additional information about marine mammals and sea turtles related to the Proposed Action 
in the following three comments: 
 
Comment 1:   
We recommend that BOEM implement an inter-organization, ecosystem-based adaptive 
management plan to guide the regulatory process associated with offshore wind energy development 
in the mid-Atlantic region, and suggest that a long-term species monitoring program be the 
cornerstone of this plan. Development of the proposed Wind Energy Areas (WEAs) would be an 
unprecedented marine construction project - the first we know of in open ocean migratory corridors for 
marine and avian species. To insure that all aspects (economic, social and cultural, and environmental) 
are equally represented through the planning processes we recommend that BOEM, in consultation with 
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and other 
stake-holder organizations, develop an inter-organization, ecosystem-based adaptive management plan. 
The management plan should be used to guide the process of research activities, SAP approval, and 
construction and operational plan (COP) approval. Specifically, we recommend that the management 
plan incorporate a comprehensive survey program designed to address current biological data gaps and",0,0

This represents an invaluable opportunity to deploy ship-board profiling wind Lidar units to collect data for resource assessment and model validation.  These data sets would be invaluable in reducing uncertainty for AEP estimates and improving numerical weather prediction models for day-ahead production forecasts and for vessel operation (O&amp;M) planning and safety.  Recent research at UMBC has confirmed the feasibility of ship-board Lidar deployment for weather model validation. See attached white paper for a discussion of the methodology, experiment and results.<br/><br/>2. As a general comment, I would stress that the risks and impacts to marine mammals from geophysical surveys for OSW development are much lower than O&amp;G exploration and development since O&amp;G requires much deeper bottom penetration and much higher sound pressure levels.   I strongly support development of OSW and oppose O&amp;G development for this and many other reasons.  <br/><br/>3.   Section 3.1.1.6 - No Action Plan.

Executive Summary  
 
Wind resource evaluation can benefit from new insights into the fundamental physical mechanisms 
responsible for variability across the rotor span, the boundary layer, and the entire region, including the 
Maryland Wind Energy Area (WEA).  This report describes how data from a variety of in-situ and 
remote sensing instruments including Lidar are being used to characterize processes in the atmosphere 
and ocean and improve their representation in simulation models.  This report also documents the 
development of a new Lidar Motion Compensation Algorithm (MCA) for vessels underway.  
 
Floating Lidar technology has the potential to replace met towers in many cases, once accepted by the 
industry.  However, current systems are integrated into floating buoys and incorporate proprietary 
MCAs, which are all designed for motion of an anchored buoy.  By developing and validating an 
algorithm that can be applied to a Lidar unit on a moving vessel,  the UMBC MCA is opening the range 
of deployment possibilities to an entirely new set of platforms.   Many types of vessels that could serve 
as Lidar platforms traverse in or near the MD WEA on a daily basis.   During WEA survey and 
construction operations,  vessels could be continuously collecting wind profile data for use in 
configuring and nudging forecast models, and fine-tuning production estimates.   The cost of lidar units 
will come down significantly as technology improves and economies of scale are realized.   Eventually, 
commercial vessels may be equipped with wind Lidar profilers and the data used in forecasting models,  
just as is often done with marine weather radar data from ships.  The preliminary validation indicates 
that the UMBC MCA has nearly identical error and uncertainty characteristics to the internal, 
proprietary Leosphere MCA used by the WindCube.  The next stage of the analysis is to use the 
Forward Model Algorithm to test the MCA under simulated wind fields and vessel speeds and motions.  
This is currently underway and an update will be provided in the next quarterly report.    
 
In the absence of strong synoptic forcing, smaller scale regional mechanisms in the Mid-Atlantic are 
revealed.  These have the potential to generate locally strong winds that may coincide with high grid 
loads [1,2 ].  Satellite sea surface temperature data often shows cool water upwelling along the coast, 
creating a low-level local baroclinic zone and changing the low level thermal stability.  There has been 
recent research on the impact of low level thermal stability on winds in the rotor layer [3,4].  The overall 
impact of such events on the wind resource offshore depends on how often they occur, which remains to 
be determined. Their predictability depends on whether the larger synoptic scale situation leads to 
conditions that make such small scale events more likely, and if any synoptic scale precursor conditions 
can be identified.   A detailed investigation of low level jet formation and its precursors is ongoing.  
 In addition,  the occurrence of negative shear conditions across the rotor layer may be more frequent 
than expected, as shown by the preliminary analysis of data from NASA-DAWN1 Lidar, and  the NOAA 
marine met stations designated CHLV2 and NDBC 44010.  This has significant implications for rotor 
design, production estimates, and power forecasting.  Further investigation of this phenomenon is 
ongoing.

2014-30767,BOEM-2014-0077-0034,"I believe that the EA was done very thoroughly and it covered many aspects that needed to be covered. The EA mentioned that the construction, maintenance, a decommission of the wind mills will have no significant impact on air quality standards especially with comparison to the air quality that already exists in the area. It is important to point out that if successful, this project could lead to the cutting down of NOx, CO2, and PM 2.5 emissions in the area due to coal powered electricity. However, I do not know the standards and data that was used to determine that the air quality in the project areas would not be affected by the projects emissions. My concern is based on what data was used to determine that the air quality in the project areas would not be affected by the project. If the data was based on a yearly basis there average would be skewed due to the fact the summer months, especially at Virginia Beach, there is an increased amount of Tourism that leads to an increase of CO2 emissions as well as other harmful substances into the air. So why does this matter? The locals are already used to their air quality decreasing during the summer months because of the tourists but how would this project affect the other 8-9 months out of the year? Will it get better or will get worse?

2014-30767,BOEM-2014-0077-0023,I live in Virginia Beach and sail in the bay and the ocean. I fish on the Atlantic shoreline and visit the beach at least 12 times a year.  I fully endorse this project in the location proposed for the preferred alternative. My daughter further recommends a protected fish area around the turbines.  I suspect the area immediately around the turbine might be a security area. This effort is needed to further use available wind resources.  I look forward to underwater turbines harvesting energy from the Gulf Stream.  ,2015-01-23T05:00:00Z,2015-01-03T14:52:32Z,,Daniel,Duquette,NA,,,,,,,,false,0,,,0,0

Growing up in Southern New Jersey, Atlantic Electric took a giant leap by installing 5 wind turbines on Atlantic City&#39;s skyline and they&#39;ve been going strong for many years.  When my husband was stationed over-seas in England eight years ago, wind farms were vast spread across the country-side and shore lines....not to mention throughout other areas of Europe.

This EA describes reasonably good details on many issues that need to be covered.  However there appear to be some gaps that I wish to bring to your attention that should be addressed:<br/><br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The EA report says on page 82 the applicant has proposed that pile driving will occur in May.  Then on page 109 the EA says pile driving will occur May through July.  Which is correct?  <br/><br/>2.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Please be more specific about the aviation safety lights (page 67) that will be used.  These need to be the most bird-friendly aviation safety lights known, which should be based on studies that have been supported by US Fish and Wildlife Service.  My understanding is that white strobe lights are the least likely to attract birds during inclement weather (which is when this issue is most critical).  This should be explicitly stated in the EA, and required in the turbine procurement specifications.<br/><br/>3.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>It is important that Dominion Virginia Power carry out post-construction monitoring during operation of the project to evaluate actual impacts from the wind turbines on birds, as stated on page 67. Post-construction monitoring is important to verify whether a problem really exists, to improve impact predictions from future scaling-up of wind power development in the area, and to guide any adaptive management that might be warranted. The EA should specify how the findings from post-construction monitoring would be used to improve operation of the wind turbine facility, as needed.  BOEM should require Dominion Virginia Power to make all the post-construction monitoring data readily available to the public.<br/><br/>4.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>There appear to be some contradictions between the EAs description of the onshore impact area from all onshore construction activities (Section 3.2.4.2, page 71) versus the photo shown at:  https://www.dom.com/corporate/what-we-do/electricity/generation/wind/virginia-offshore-wind-technology-advancement-project.  Specifically, in this photo (section titled Onshore Interconnection), the cable right-of-way appears to be cutting through a forested area and a wetland. Meanwhile, the EA (Section 3.2.7.2, page 122) states that no clearing of native vegetation is expected during construction along the route of the onshore cables. Which version is correct?<br/><br/>5.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Please describe in more detail the vegetation and the land cover of the onshore impact area.  <br/><br/>6.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>On page 105 the EA says:  compliance with the NOAA speed restrictions within the MidAtlantic SMAs of 10 knots for vessels 19.8 m (65 ft) or greater during the period of November 1 through April 30 would further reduce risks of vessels colliding with endangered NARWs. While this is positive, the EA should explain further how ship speeds would be monitored and enforced. For example, would each ship have a black box that automatically records the ships speed and transmits this information to regulators and the public? Would the black box also set off an automatic, loud alarm bell such that all crew members could hear when the ship is speeding, and influence how this is operated such that it will stay within required guidelines?  What will be the penalties (fines, suspension, dismissal, or criminal prosecution) for violations?  How will this compliance information be recorded and reported?<br/><br/>7.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>How would compliance with the important procedures specified in Appendix A of Section 7.1 (Paragraph 12) be monitored, enforced, and reported? This is particularly relevant to the cessation of pile driving when marine mammals or sea turtles are nearby.  <br/><br/>8.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>This EA describes only this demonstration project rather than what would likely occur if this demonstration project shows that Virginia Off shore Wind Energy Development is a viable low-carbon electricity source for Virginia.  The two demonstration turbines will be decommissioned after their useful life which potentially could be as long as 50 years from now.  What will happen once research results are shown?  What will this project lead to for Virginia?<br/><br/>Thank you very much for the opportunity to comment and provide input to this project.

RE: Draft regulatory guide (DG), DG-5027, ""General Use of Locks in Protection and Control of
Facilities and Special Nuclear Materials, Classified Matter, and Safeguards Information.""
Dear Ms. Bladey,
The Organization of Agreement States (OAS) Executive Board (Board) has reviewed the above
document and respectfully submits the following comments for consideration by the NRC.
1. Although there is good general information about locks in this guidance document, all of the
specific instruction is for Parts 50 and 73 licensees or licensees with safeguards information.
It's unclear what Increased Controls licensees are supposed to take away from this document.
The Board recommends adding specific examples for Increased Controls licensees that are not
Part 50 or 73 licensees or licensees with safeguards information.
2. Additionally, the Board recommends the following language be added to the document: ""This
document is intended as additional voluntary guidance on the security requirements found in
Part 37. Licensees need not apply this guidance in order to comply with Part 37.""
We appreciate the chance to comment on this subject, and stand ready to answer any questions you may
have.

Re: Draft Regulatory Guide DG-5027
Dear Ms. Blady:
The Virginia Radioactive Materials Program (VRMP) has reviewed this draft guidance on ""General
Use of Locks"" and provides the following comments for the NRC's review:
1. The VRPM recommends verbiage be included in Section B, ""Discussion"" that licensees under the
Part 37 regulations are currently in-line with the security requirements and that this guidance is to
help licensees understand the complexity of locks that can be used.
2. The VRMP does not understand the following statement made on page 18: ""However, voluntarily
using the subject matter in the guidance may change a licensee's plan such that the NRC review
may be required under the provisions of 10 CFR 37.43...."". The security plan required under 10
CFR 37.43 should always be part of a license inspection and not just subject to review based upon
the licensee using this guidance document on locking devices. The VRMP recommends removing
this statement from the guidance.
3. The VRMP recommends that discussion regarding Part 37 licensees be separated from licensees in
Part 50, 70 and 73. The VRMP contends that Part 37 licensees may believe they are required to
follow this guidance and/or amend their license to commit to this guidance even though that is not
required in the licensing requirements for Part 37.
The VRMP thanks you for your consideration of our comments and if you have any questions please
contact Mike Welling at 804-864-8168 or mike.welling(&vdh.virginia.gov.

(Jan. 2, 2015) (Docket ID NRC-2014-0276)
Project Number: 689
Dear Ms. Bladey:
On behalf of the nuclear energy industry, the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI)' appreciates the opportunity to
provide comments on the Draft Regulatory Guide DG-5027; ""General Use of Locks in Protection and Control of
Facilities and Special Nuclear Materials, Classified Matter, and Safeguards Information,"" 80 FR 53 (Jan. 2,
2015) (Docket ID NRC-2014-0276).
The purpose of this Draft Regulatory Guide (DG-5027) is to describe to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC) staff, the methods and procedures acceptable for the selection, use, and control of locking
devices in the protection of areas, facilities, and specific types of information. Our overarching comment is
that there appears to be no risk-informed graded approach employed with regard to the level or type of
material being protected and that the guidance may not present a clear understanding of applicability.
NEI is the organization responsible for establishing unified nuclear industry policy on matters affecting the nuclear energy industry, including
the regulatory aspects of generic operational and technical issues. NEI's members include all utilities licensed to operate commercial nuclear
power plants in the United States, nuclear plant designers, major architect/engineering firms, fuel fabrication facilities, materials licensees,
and other organizations and individuals involved in the nuclear energy industry.

1 3 B1.1 In addition, the guide contains updated references and relevant regulations fwe=}
where identified.
Reason: typo
2 5 1 Replace: Sentences two, three and four with:
""If the combination of a lock is changed by an intruder, that person would have access,
but an authorized user would not.""
Reason: Clarity.
3 5 2 The combinations of some key-change locks can be changed directly when the lock is in
the open position, while others must have the existing combination reentered f=tae
..d__' when the access is in the open position to permit the combination
change.
Reason: It isn't always to a different index; this detail isn't helpful to most readers
4 5 4 First sentence: replace ""(Ref. 11)"" with ""(Ref. 12)""
Reason: Ref. 12 is correct
5 5 4 Replace second and third sentences with:
""To be approved by the General Services Administration (GSA), security
containers and security vault doors and doors for facilities approved for open
storage of classified information must be secured with a lock approved under
Federal Specification FF-L-2740. The only exception is for field safes, safes
specifically designed and built for protection of classified material under field
conditions. These may use a lock meeting Underwriters Laboratories Inc. (UL)
Standard 768, ""Combination Locks,"" (Ref. 13), Group 1 or 1 R. Currently, field
safes are manufactured with locks meeting Federal Specification FF-L-2937.""
Reason: Original had errors and was awkwardly written; Ref. 13 is correct.
6 5 5 Replace second, third, and fourth sentences with:
""Six locks have been approved under Federal Specification FF-L-2740: Mas-
Hamilton Group models X-07 and X-08, Kaba Mas models X-09 and X-10, and
Sargent and Greenleaf models 2740 and 2740B. All six models are
electromechanical locks; the X-07, X-08, X-09, and X-10 are generator-powered,
and the 2740 and 2740B are battery-powered. While all six models are
approved, only the X-10 and 2740B are currently being produced.""
Reason: Original had errors and was not current.

Dear Ms. Bladey: co
Thank you for the opportunity to review the generic Environmental Impact Statement for
License Renewal of Nuclear Plants Supplement 54 regarding Byron Station, Units 1 and 2
(Docket NRC-2013-0178). With respect to the Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement
(SEIS), we have the following comments.
The SEIS includes an assessment of potential effects upon federally listed species that may occur
in the project area. The assessment concludes that, because no suitable habitat is present,
relicensing the Byron Nuclear Plant will have no effect on Myotis septentrionalis (Northern
long-eared bat), Myotis sodalis (Indiana bat), Lespedeza leptostachya (prairie bush clover),
Platanthera leucophaea (Eastern prairie fringed orchid), or Daleafoliosa (leafy prairie clover).
We concur with your determination.
This precludes the need for further action on this project as required under Section 7 of the
Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. If project plans change or portions of the
proposed project were not evaluated, it is our recommendation that the changes be submitted for
our review. These comments are provided in accordance with the Endangered Species Act of
1973 (87 Stat. 884, as amended; 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq).
This letter provides comments under the authority of and in accordance with provisions of the
Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (48 Stat. 401, as amended; 16 U.S.C. 661 et seq.); and the
Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. Questions concerning this letter should be
directed to Mr. Jon Duyvejonck (telephone 309.757-5800, ext. 207).
Sincerely,

that 
VOWTAP 
is 
subject 
to 
Federal 
Nonattainment 
New

(NSR), 
which 
it 
is 
not. 
VOWTAP 
would 
be 
subject 
to 
major 
NSR 
permitting 
(i.e
., 
PSD

only 
if there 
is 
potential 
to 
emit 
over 
2SO 
tons 
per 
year 
(TPV) 
of 
a single 
criteria 
pollutant. 
Because 
the 
potential 
to 
emit 
is 
less 
than 
2SO 
TPY 
but 
greater 
than 
100 
TPY, 
VOWTAP 
would 
be 
considered 
a State 
Major

subject 
to 
the 
same 
regulations 
as 
minor 
NSR 
permits, 
but 
administered 
by 
the 
Virginia 
Department 
of 
Environmental 
Quality 
(DEQ). 
Additionally, 
because 
DEQ 
has 
been 
authorized 
to 
implement 
and 
enforce 
the 
Outer 
Continental 
Shelf 
air 
regulations, 
VOWTAP 
would 
be 
subject 
to 
permitting 
through 
DEQ 
and 
not 
the 
USEPA. 
Dominion 
has 
applied 
for 
an 
air

anticipates 
receipt 
in

Dominion 
concluded 
further

determine 
whether 
these 
anomalies 
are 
potential 
archaeological 
resources, 
since 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
make 
this 
determination 
based 
on 
the 
geophysical 
signature 
alone. 
In 
addition, 
a qualified 
marine 
archaeologist 
recommended 
a 
buffer 
area 
for 
each 
anomaly 
of 
either 
114.8 
or 
164ft 
{3S

as 
appropriate. 
BOEM 
investigated 
the 
anomalies 
with 
divers

concluded 
that 
one 
is 
a 
large 
concrete 
anchor 
of 
no 
significance.

Re: Draft Plant-Specific Supplement 54 to the Generic Environmental Impact
Statement for the License Renewal of Byron Station, Units I and 2, Ogle County,
Illinois - NI-REG-1437 - CEQ #20140383
Dear Ms. Bladey:
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has reviewed the Draft Supplemental Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS) for the above-mentioned project prepared by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC). Our comments are provided pursuant to the National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA), the Council on Environmental Quality's NEPA Ioplementin Re, glations (40 Ct R
1500-1508), and Section 309 of the Clean Air Act.
Byron is a two-unit nuclear power plant located in Ogle County, Illinois. It began operation in
February 1985 (Unit 1) and January 1987 (Unit 2). The site is located on approximately 1,782
acres, including the main site area and a right-of-way to the Rock River for the circulating water
makeup intake and blowdown discharge pipelines. The nuclear reactor for each unit is a
Westinghouse pressurized-water reactor producing 2,370 megawatts electric (MWe).
Byron is owned and operated by Exelon Generation Company, LLC (the applicant). The
applicant applied to NRC for an extension to its operating license, extending operation for an
additional 20-year period. Based on information provided by the applicant, NRC's preferred
alternative is to grant the 20-year extension.
The NRC developed a Generic EIS to streamline the license renewal process based on the
premise that environmental impacts of most nuclear power plant license renewals are similar.
NRC develops facility-specific Supplemental EIS documents as the facilities apply for license
renewal. EPA acknowledges that mitigation measures that are un-related to nuclear safety and
security cannot be included in the NRC license. This includes, but is not limited to, diesel
emissions reduction measures. However, because we find these measures to be value-added, we
continue to recomnend them to the applicant for any construction activities and include them in
our comment letters. We encourage the applicant to incorporate mitigation measures into the
project, wherever possible.

Based on our review of the Draft Supplemental EIS, we have rated the document and project as
EC-1, Environmental Concerns - Adequate Information. EPA has identified additional
potential mitigation measures and some areas in need of clarification. We have enclosed our
ratings definitions and our detailed comments.
EPA commends NRC and the applicant on improved transparency in this document when
contrasted with EISs for some other nuclear power plants that we have reviewed in recent years.
We particularly note the improved compliance with plain language writing requirements. EPA
found this document more easily understood, particularly for those without a technical, nuclear-
related background. Reviewers also required fewer cross-references throughout the document;
references often included specific locations within documents (rather than simply citing a full
document). EPA encourages continued improvement by NRC on this matter.
EPA also commends NRC for specifying that certain methodologies used for risk determination
meet all Federal regulation1 , particularly ones that are related, but covered independently by both
EPA and NRC.
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this document. If you have any questions or wish
to discuss any aspect of this document, please contact Elizabeth Poole of my staff at 312-353-
2087 or poole.elizabeth@epa.gov.

2014-30756,NRC-2013-0178-0011,"DOCKET NUMBER NRC-2013-0178 Byron Nuclear Power Plant Relicensing<br/><br/>I oppose the license renewal for the Byron Plant because it is a not environmentally sound and is a serious threat to human health and safety. <br/><br/>I am a 72 year old male retiree, residing ca. 20 miles south-southwest of the facility. I have family members--including children--living 5-10 miles from the plant and I fear for their health and safety. Research reveals increased cancer risk for those living within 10 miles of nuclear power plants and other studies show that nuclear workers have a greater risk of cancer than the survivors of Hiroshima/Nagasaki bombings in WWII. Nuclear power plants emit radiation daily and more serious releases occur during refueling.<br/><br/>There is no safe level of radiation. The health consequences of exposure to continued low levels are  worse than one high level exposure. <br/><br/>Exelon&#39;s competence in operating Byron is questionable, as indicated in &quot;Toxic Management Erodes Safety at &#39;World&#39;s Safest&#39; Nuclear Plant&quot; by Dreux Richard (The Japan Times, March 11, 2013). The allegations in this article have not been adequately or publicly addressed by Exelon or the NRC in my estimation, and the suggestion by the NRC Public Relations staff  that I dig through reams of documents to see if the situation was adequately dealt with leaves me cold. An associate of mine was a career employee at Byron who took early retirement out of frustration and disgust, stating, &quot;Nuclear power is fine--if its done right.&quot;  (And also indicates that most of the above mentioned ariticle is true). <br/><br/>I recommend tthat the NRC institute policies and procedures to assure that Exelon and other plant operators maintain management practices that do not intimidate employees who are trying to ensure safe operation of nuclear power plants, and to inform the public of violations of said policies and remediation of said violations.  Toxic management does not assure safety for the health of the environment, the public, and staff.<br/><br/>The alternatives to the renewal of the Byron license are clear and viable: Wind, solar and other renewable energy sources are now environmentally and economically sound. It is time to let this Nuclear Neanderthal technology die a hopefully swift death.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>",2015-03-20T00:00:00Z,2015-02-20T00:00:00Z,2015-02-23T00:00:00Z,Anonymous,Anonymous,,,,,,,,,false,0,,,0,2
2014-30756,NRC-2013-0178-0007,"On behalf of UCS, I submitted FOIA/PA-2015-0082 seeking Final Safety Analysis Report records received after October 1, 2001, by the NRC from all nuclear plant owners, including the Byron licensee. By letter dated January 7, 2015, the NRC administratively closed my request. By email dated December 30, 2014, the NRC staff notified me that the estimated page count for the requested records was 448,000 just from Region IV. That email estimated approximately 4,000 pages per FSAR per reactor with multiple updates per reactor since October 1, 2001 -- accounting for the hundreds of thousands of pages per region. <br/><br/>By withholding this vast quantity of FSAR material from the public, the NRC is significantly impairing our ability to review and comment on licensing request such as this one for Byron. The FSARs describe the safety-related structures, systems, and components at the plant and further describe their role in preventing or mitigating design basis transients and accidents. <br/><br/>NRC regulation 10 CFR 50.59 requires licensees to screen proposed modifications and changes to plant operating procedures to see whether the proposed changes might reduce safety margins approved by the NRC in a significant way. If so, the changes cannot be made until after the NRC reviews and formally approves them. The 10 CFR 50.59 screenings and evaluations rely heavily on information in the FSARs. The FSARs are also extensively used by NRC&#39;s reviewers when evaluating licensee requests for licensing actions.<br/><br/>As stated above, by withholding hundreds of thousands of pages of FSARs from the public, the NRC is significantly impairing our ability to participating in licensing proceedings in a meaningful away. The licensees and the NRC staff rely heavily on the FSAR information while preparing and reviewing requests for licensing actions, but the NRC&#39;s withholding prevents the public from reviewing this information. <br/><br/>The hundreds of thousands of pages of vital information being withheld by the NRC staff is being done so improperly. Entire FSARs, such as the recent updates for Beaver Valley Unit 2 and Watts Bar Unit 2, were made publicly available by the NRC in their entirety. This demonstrates that FSARs do not contain classified, safeguards, or sensitive information that must be withheld from public disclosure. <br/><br/>The NRC should not approve this licensing request at Byron until after the agency makes all the FSAR information for Byron publicly available and gives the public sufficient time to review this information. Failing to do so transforms this licensing process into a mockery of justice. ",2015-02-04T00:00:00Z,2015-01-21T00:00:00Z,2015-01-21T00:00:00Z,David,Lochbaum,,,,,,,,,false,0,,,0,2

BYRON BULLET POINTS .-H
Feb 2, 20:15 _ kC/r)
1.) FACTS:
! Byron has been slated by Exeton fior possible closure due to unprofitability.
* One way utilities use to regain profitability is to cut costs; at a plant like
Byron, this could mean cutting staff, cutting O&M, or both
* Exelon's comments on unprofitability may indicate that it has already engaged
in actions that have degraded the safety levels at the reactor site.
SCOMMENT/CONCERN:
o NRC needs to insure that Exelon cuts neither staff nor O&M spending,
and that both are kept at levels to insure the safety of the public., the
workers and the plant.
o NRC needs to publicly guarantee that any workers expressing safety
concerns publicly do not experience any form of retribution, as has
previously occurred (refer to Dreux Richards concerns)
o Can a utility publicly stating it may have to close a reactor site be
serious about continuing the costly relicensing process, and vice versa?
And be serious about meeting its requirements in full?
2.) FACTS:
* Byron has been slated by l1'xelon for possible closure due to unprofitability.
o Worker layoffs and other economic. disruption are guaranteed when Exelon
makes the decision to close Byron, for whatever reason it chooses
o COMMENTS/CONCERN:
i. As part of the relicensing process, NRC needs to publicly affirm that
sufficient funds are currently available in the decommissioning fund to
meet NRC requirements for decommissioning, as outlined in current
NRC decommissioning calculation lbrmulas.
it. A ""just transition fund."" needs to be established immediately, as a
condition for community acceptance of relicensing, that financially
prepares the workers and community for a loss of incomes and
economic benefits. This needs to be negotiated among community
leaders, workers and their union. leadership, and Exelon management;
it can also be a part of negotiations with the Legislature, Exelon, and
workers' unions.

To Whom It May Concern,
We would like to take a few minutes to comment on how the Exelon Nuclear Facility in Byron,
Illinois is a testament of how a company is good for the community and how it helps in its
endeavor to be a good example and a good caregiver to the community and Mother Earth.
Byron has shown how it helps the community and surrounding area with its willingness to give
back. They have been there to help with financial support for thle rehabilitation of any animal
and migratory bird that has been hurt or injured. They have helped with the rehabilitation and
transportation costs for wildlife and to make sure they have a safe place to be released back into
the wild.
Foxelon is also been very good to the community in its willingness to go the extra mile to do
education programs and outreach program to schools, community centers, etc. They show how
Exelon wants to be a good caregiver to Mother Earth and its neighbors. They have asked
""1100"" Haven to help them with environmental programs in tile community and have helped us
in our endeavor to present The Environment and how you can help give back. We teach and talk
about companies that show they care about the wildlife and how everyone can help the
environment.
On another note, Exelon has shown that it has been very responsible in its care and upkeep of
their facility in Byron. They are very good for the community and its surounding area.
They provide needed jobs to many people. These include all the personal at the plant, the
security guards and of course, the tradesmen like the electricians, plumbers, pipefitters, welders
and all the other trades to keep the facilities in top condition. They are very good about their
scheduled outages to keep everything in the best shape. They police themselves very well.
Exelon is also good for the community in the revenue they provide for the government agencies
that receive funding from their operation of the nuclear plant.
