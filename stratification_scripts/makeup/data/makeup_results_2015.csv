The Florida Association of Livestock Markets supports the comments made by LMA on this proposed rule. <br/><br/>We appreciate USDA&#39;s engagement of stakeholders in this commenting process and hope that adjustments are made based on the feedback. <br/><br/>We&#39;re particularly interested in seeing changes to the market duties in the approved livestock marketing facility agreement to avoid situations where markets are taking on a policing role or being asked to agree to things they legally cannot do - such as not allowing a livestock owner to ship cattle. <br/><br/>We also hope USDA backs away from the proposed ADT changes relating to Farm of Origin. <br/><br/>Sincerely, <br/>Florida Association of Livestock Markets

April 15, 2015 <br/><br/>To Whom It May Concern:<br/><br/>The following are the comments of the Pennsylvania Livestock Marketing Association on the proposed rule regarding Approved Livestock Marketing Facilities (Docket No. APHIS-2014-0018). <br/><br/>We thank you for the chance to provide feedback on the proposed rule. While we appreciate the time and effort taken to update the regulatory scheme surrounding Approved Livestock Marketing Facilities, we feel that USDA missed the mark in components of this proposed rule that reduces ADT rule flexibilities for cattle moving to an Approved Livestock Marketing Facility. The proposal limits the flexibility to only cattle coming to the facility from a Farm of Origin. Additionally, defining Farm of Origin to the farm where livestock are produced or maintained for at least four months prior to movement is unnecessarily broad  restricting movement even more. <br/><br/>In Pennsylvania, most of our livestock markets do business with out-of-state customers on a regular basis. This is both a function of being a smaller state and of cattle movement patterns. Additionally, many of our customers selling at market are small producers who bring just one or a few head of cattle to market at a time. For these small producers, it would be extremely expensive to have to have a veterinarian visit the farm to write a health certificate, especially when you consider the fact the cost of this health certificate could only be spread out over a few animals at the most. <br/><br/>This added expense could drive producers to sell at a different market just to avoid crossing state lines. They also may consider selling out of the market environment where it is less likely animal health and livestock movement requirements. <br/><br/>This would lead to less traceability rather than more traceability. <br/><br/>Sincerely, <br/><br/>Pennsylvania Livestock Marketing Association <br/>

The industry desperately needs these changes! As a Livestock Market operator in southern Michigan since 1956, we have seen many changes over the years, notably a decrease of Livestock Marketing options. We have several customers from northern Ohio that choose us to market their slaughter cattle. Requiring to have an IVCI issued by a vet for each consignment of slaughter cattle would not only be costly, but not necessary. These cattle go to slaughter and are inspected by USDA at their destination for harvest. To be an &quot;Approved USDA Livestock Facility&quot; to accept out of state slaughter cattle and be required to have a Vet at the site on sale days would serve no purpose. Our local vet on call would allow his/her services on the farms and not pin him/her down at our premise for 6 hours each sale day. These out of state consignments are currently and would be continued to be USDA back tagged, penned separate, not co mingled, and sent from our facilities to slaughter. In addition, they are individually identified with RFID or USDA approved metal ear tags. An &quot;Owner-Shipper&quot; statement to accompany the cattle is no problem for the farmers or truckers. These changes are a step forward to allow livestock marketing across state lines, and will enhance disease traceability.<br/><br/>Randy Heselschwerdt, Napoleon Livestock Commission Co.

all exemptions should be taken away. if livestock ove from state to state, before they leave the original state they should be certified as healthful. I do not believe sick livestock should be moved from the original site. it dos not matter whether they move to a livestock facility. I do not believe unhealthy livestock should be moved to any new site. I do not believe that regulations that protect America should be done away with.

Dear Mr. Shea, <br/><br/>As the association representing local livestock auction markets in the state of South Carolina, we are writing to provide comments on the proposed rule regarding Approved Livestock Marketing Facilities (Docket No. APHIS-2014-0018). <br/><br/>Generally, we support the comments submitted by Dan Harris, president of the national Livestock Marketing Association. In particular, we share his concerns with the Farm of Origin changes to the ADT rule limiting the feasibility of us continue to do business with our out-of-state customers. Adult cattle coming into our markets are documented and inspected upon arrival, so this adjustment is unnecessary. <br/><br/>We also feel strongly that the agreement should remain in the regulation so markets have the ability to formally comment on any changes just as we are doing now. <br/><br/>In addition, we agree that the language in the proposed agreement should be adjusted so it is clear livestock markets are not solely responsible for all livestock movement and animal health requirements. Our producers, veterinarians, and animal health officials also play an important role. <br/><br/>Our final comment is unique to South Carolina. We have state inspectors that attend each of our livestock auctions. We feel this resource market owners should be able to be utilize, if they chose to do so, to help address the shortage of private veterinarians and increase traceability. This could be accomplished by allowing these state inspectors the ability to write health papers or alternative movement documents to keep livestock moving. <br/><br/>If you have any questions about these comments, please contact John Kissee at 770-596-0128. <br/><br/>South Carolina Livestock Marketing Association <br/>

To whom it may concern,<br/><br/>I am a law student in my final year of law school at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Your proposed rule stood out to me as I had previously taken an animal law seminar in which I wrote a paper focusing, in part, on the interstate transportation of rodeo broncs. In doing so, I spoke about the federal Twenty-Eight Hour Law (49 USC 80502) as well as the regulations adopted by the United States Department of Agriculture as mentioned in 9 C.F.R. 89. Noticing that your proposed rule overlaps with much of research I encountered in writing my paper, I would offer the following comments as to the proposed revision to Part 71.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>I understand the practicality of your decision to revise 71.20 as simply requiring a veterinarian on-call rather than on the premise at all times, however I am concern that the language in this section is too board as to who determines whether an animal may need an interstate certificate of veterinary inspection (ICVI) before leaving the facility after sale. For example, should this determinate be left up to someone who profits financially from having these animals shipped to another facility despite their health conditions, I have serious concerns for its vague phrasing.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Further, the restatement in 71.20(a) of 8303 of the Animal Health Protection Act (AHPA, 7 U.S.C. 8301 et seq.) stating that APHIS may carry out operations and measures to control, or eradicate any pest or disease of livestock also seems rather ambiguous. I understand that should pests or disease be detected in livestock, there is a strong health and safety interest in having them eradicated, however being a strong animal welfare advocate I would simply ask that this be done as humanely as possible by adding said language to your restatement.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Jennifer Trunk

The West Virginia LMA is the trade association of local livestock markets located across West Virginia. <br/><br/>We would like to thank USDA for the work put into this proposal and the opportunity for industry feedback. <br/><br/>There are many positive pieces of the proposal. These include the ability to have veterinarians on call, the use of existing documents as owner shipper statements, and consolidating terminology to the single, more descriptive, term of &quot;approved livestock marketing facilities.&quot; <br/><br/>At the same time, there are some pieces that could be improved through adjustments. In particular, the appeals process should be strengthened not weakened. Also, markets should not lose the ability to make formal comments on changes to the requirements listed in the agreement. This right would be lost if the agreement language was taken out of the regulation. <br/><br/>We hope adjustments can be made in these areas. <br/><br/>Sincerely, <br/>West Virginia LMA

I think backtags should be applied in front of the hip.  Livestock should be tagged as soon as they arrive at the marketing facility from farm of origin whether interstate or intrastate.  Veterinarians have not been at the local sale barns all day around here in years and the rules should reflect this. Having a veterinarian &#39;on call&#39; is fine.

To Whom It May Concern:<br/> <br/>I am writing to provide comments on USDAs proposed changes to the Approved Livestock Marketing Facilities and Animal Disease Traceability regulations (Docket No. APHIS-2014-0018).<br/> <br/>As the President and CEO of Clovis Livestock Auction, Im concerned about a couple pieces of this proposal. One major concern I have is with the market duties in the proposed Approved Livestock Marketing Facility agreement. To me, it seems USDA would like markets to serve as the police of animal movement requirements. This is a government role that should not be passed on to private businesses. While we work with our buyers and sellers to help them meet requirements by having a veterinarian at our market, enforcing regulations is not a role markets should have to take on. The markets duties in the Approved Livestock Marketing Facility agreement should be adjusted to reflect this.<br/> <br/>I also am concerned about the portion of the proposed rule making changes to what is required to bring adult beef cattle and dairy cattle of any age across state lines to an Approved Livestock Marketing Facility. Our auction market is located in eastern New Mexico, close to the Texas border. Due to this, we have many customers crossing state lines to sell or buy cattle.<br/> <br/>Under the proposal, out-of-state producers selling cattle 18 months of age or older would have to get a health certificate before bringing these cattle to sell at our market, unless the cattle are coming from the farm where they are born or have been for four months.  Getting a veterinarian to visit a farm and write a health certificate can be expensive. In this rule, USDA has recognized that access to large animal veterinarians is a very real problem.  My concern is that USDA could be driving customers away from selling out our market by requiring health certificates prior to arrival. This is unnecessary as we have a veterinarian at our market and also record needed traceability information when cattle arrive.<br/> <br/>I believe the farm of origin piece of the rule would have a negative impact on my business and put livestock markets that happen to be located close to a state line at a competitive disadvantage. Because of this, my strong recommendation is that USDA does not move forward this component of the proposed rule.<br/> <br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/> <br/>Sincerely,<br/>Charlie Rogers

Not sure if this relates directly to the proposed changes, but two points:<br/><br/>1) The ADT Rule has created a potential &quot;traceability loophole&quot; in allowing cattle to move interstate to an approved tagging site with no ID and no CVI. This should happen only if the receiving tagging site is required to tag with official ID and maintain records in such a manner that animals are traceable back to the state and ship-from location. For example, Virginia allows breeding age cattle to be imported with no ID and no CVI if they are moving to an approved market and tagging site in VA, but they require that cattle are tagged with 840 RFID and usually a back tag that can be correlated with seller/buyer records in market files. The 840 tag provides traceability going forward; the back tag provides backward traceability.<br/><br/>2) It is difficult to get dairy calves/steers tagged with official ear tags at Virginia markets due to number of animals handled. If these animals are moving to other states in a fairly direct manner (similar to cull cattle), back tags may provide adequate traceability if correlated with seller/buyer records on both ends (shipping and receiving locations). Current back tags could (if appropriate) also be scanned with bar code readers to improve efficiency and accuracy of data capture. For example, dairy calves/steers in VA tagged with back tags and correlated to seller/buyer records; animals could be tagged with ear tags in receiving state, which should be correlated with VA back tags. Back tags are cheap, unique when paired with a date and location, stay on fairly well for short-term movements and are easier to capture than metal tags.

As to back tag placement: The most effective placement is in the hollow behind the shoulder. When placed back by the hip if a cow is mounted prior to the glue drying the tag is often dislodged. Tags also stay much better in the spring when animals are sheading if a curry comb is used to remove loose hair prior to application. Having worked the tagging chute at an auction yard for 3 years prior to my 26 year veterinary career where I have used numerous back tags I have found this to be the most effective placement.

In addition, allowing applications to remain active for four years as opposed to the current one year, will enable the BIA to have a better sense of the current housing needs without the concern that less sophisticated applicants would fall off the waiting list while their housing needs remain unmet.  The growing waitlists remains a serious concern and until additional resources are made available to meet these needs, these steps are necessary to best meet the needs of those most at risk. <br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Rural tribal communities have some of the highest poverty rates, unemployment rates and adolescent suicide rates of any communities in the United States.  Providing quality long-term housing is a prerequisite for familial stability as well as wealth creation.

The Housing Improvement Program from the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe would like to submit a comment to the proposed rule change of the Housing Improvement Program regulations, regarding the increase in the age requirement from 55 years of age to 62 years of age. For the record we oppose any change to this rule. The rationale for the proposed rule change, stated thusly, &quot;To provide Tribes with flexibility to better address lengthy waiting lists of Tribal members awaiting housing assistance,&quot; does not serve the interests of the membership of the CRST. Lengthy waiting lists are a result of, and demonstrate the needs of our constituent population. In short, more funding for the BIA Housing Improvement plan would constitute a more rational solution to the issue of lengthy waiting lists currently maintained by Tribes.<br/><br/>We oppose the proposed rule change regarding points awarded to households with disabled members. This rule change does not take into account the fact that households with two disabled members. This rule change does not take into account the fact that households with two disabled members often experience high mortality rates. Situations where one disabled member deceases before the household is served may put the household at a distinct disadvantage in future funding cycles. We would like to keep this rule unchanged.

The United South and Eastern Tribes, Inc.

USET is dedicated to enhancing the development of Tribal nations, to improving the capabilities of Tribal governments, and assisting USET Member Tribes in dealing effectively with public policy issues and in serving the broad needs of Indian people.<br/><br/>Given the important role that the HIP plays in addressing the unmet housing needs of low-income American Indians, USET is pleased that the Bureau recognizes the need for updates and improvements to the program. However, we have concerns related to a number of the proposed changes, especially in light of the HIPs limited appropriation. In addition, we note that the Proposed Rule does not address the HIPs funding formula methodology, which does not currently function well for USET Tribes.<br/><br/>USET appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on the Proposed Rule and looks forward to the opportunity to provide additional input as rulemaking proceeds. Should you have questions or require additional information please do not hesitate to contact Ms. Liz Malerba, USET Director of Policy and Legislative Affairs, at (202)-624-3550 or by e-mail at Lmalerba@usetinc.org.<br/><br/>

The down payment assistance funds will help Native American families qualify for homeownership financing.  Since this is a new category and expands the allowable HIP Programs housing assistance funds and services there should be clarification that these funds may be used for: down payment assistance, closing costs, education in financial literacy and homebuyer education and counseling. <br/>o<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Income Eligibility for Category D In order to insure that the HIP down payment assistance is available to families who can afford mortgage financing, we recommend that income eligibility be defined for Category D by using the definition provided by the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act (NAHASDA) regulations.  This would allow eligibility by participants with annual income that is 80 percent of the area median income or United States median income, whichever is higher.  (12 CFR 1000.10)  <br/><br/>o<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Previous Assistance While we recognize the need to serve clients who have not previously received assistance through the HIP program, we recommend that the restriction from being eligible for the HIP down payment program not apply to recipients of Category B rehabilitation funds if the funds were received prior to a certain time, e.g. more than 25 years ago (proposed Section 256.6 (g)).<br/><br/>o<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Set-Aside In order to promote the use of the down payment assistance program, we recommend that 10 percent of each Regions HIP allocation be set-aside for Category D.  If the funds are not expended by the end of the fiscal year, they could be reprogrammed for other HIP categories.  It is important to document need for Category D so future appropriation requests can be increased to meet the need to assist Native American families with down payment assistance. <br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Ranking Factors I support adding the new ranking factors of homelessness, overcrowding, and dilapidated housing will help identify the housing needs of the poorest of the poor.  As the need for safe, sanitary and affordable housing increases it is very important to document the need (funded and unfunded) for all categories so future appr

Regarding the ranking factor of Annual Household Income, and the change of 125% to 150%, I would recommend increasing further, to 175%. This would allow for the people deepest in poverty to get ahead on the list, so that they can get their housing repaired/improved faster. These people deep in poverty need it especially, so that they have a reliable place to stay as they start to climb out of poverty.

March 6, 2015 <br/><br/>VIA ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION<br/>Bureau of Indian Affairs <br/>Attn:<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Elizabeth Appel, Director, Office of Regulatory Affairs &amp; Collaborative Action<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Subject:<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Comments on Proposed Amendments to Housing Improvement Program, Docket Nos. BIA-2014-0004<br/><br/>My name is Christina Sturdevant and I am a first year law student in California.  <br/><br/>First, the proposed amendment to the Housing Improvement Program that will increase the income guidelines fits squarely within the Bureau of Indian Affairs mission.  The Bureau of Indian Affairs mission is to enhance the quality of life, promote economic opportunity, and to carry out the responsibility to protect and improve the trust assets of American Indians, Indian tribes, and Alaska Natives. If the income guidelines are increased from 125 percent to 150 percent of the federal poverty level, more American Indian and Alaska Native families will be eligible for the housing improvement grants.  Individuals living at 150 percent of the federal poverty level, while slightly more advantaged than those living at 125 percent of the poverty level, still require adequate housing conditions.  The increase of 25 percent will allow families who do not have financial resources to repair or renovate their existing homes.<br/><br/>Second, the Act should be amended to increase the monetary limit of funding granted to Category A and Category B recipients.  Category A and Category B recipients currently receive a maximum of $2,500 to repair or renovate their homes.  As stated in the proposal, this amount is inadequate to create material changes to the existing homes of impoverished families.  Of course, any funding creates a dent, but $2,500 is unlikely to make any lasting improvements.  For example, re-carpeting a small apartment costs at least $1,000.  Surely, the Bureau of Indian Affairs mission to enhance the quality of life of American Indians, Indian tribes, and Alaska Natives is only minimally carried out by such a small repair.  While an apartment may be re-carpeted, there might be termite damage (several thousands of dollars to repair), water damage, and any host of costly repairs that need fixing.  A grant of merely $2,500 simply is not enough to truly enhance the quality of life of these families.  Further, these amendments will advance the requirements of 25 U.S.C.  13, which state that, the Bureau of Indian affairs use money appropriated to them by Congress to assist in the relief of distress and conservation of health of Indians throughout the United States.  This proposed amendment would improve the health of impoverished Native American families by improving basic needs.  For example, water damage can lead to mold, bed bugs can lead to a host of health issues and unfit housing

I live in Virginia Beach and sail in the bay and the ocean. I fish on the Atlantic shoreline and visit the beach at least 12 times a year.  I fully endorse this project in the location proposed for the preferred alternative. My daughter further recommends a protected fish area around the turbines.  I suspect the area immediately around the turbine might be a security area. This effort is needed to further use available wind resources.  I look forward to underwater turbines harvesting energy from the Gulf Stream.

I believe that the EA was done very thoroughly and it covered many aspects that needed to be covered. The EA mentioned that the construction, maintenance, a decommission of the wind mills will have no significant impact on air quality standards especially with comparison to the air quality that already exists in the area. It is important to point out that if successful, this project could lead to the cutting down of NOx, CO2, and PM 2.5 emissions in the area due to coal powered electricity. However, I do not know the standards and data that was used to determine that the air quality in the project areas would not be affected by the projects emissions. My concern is based on what data was used to determine that the air quality in the project areas would not be affected by the project. If the data was based on a yearly basis there average would be skewed due to the fact the summer months, especially at Virginia Beach, there is an increased amount of Tourism that leads to an increase of CO2 emissions as well as other harmful substances into the air. So why does this matter? The locals are already used to their air quality decreasing during the summer months because of the tourists but how would this project affect the other 8-9 months out of the year? Will it get better or will get worse? Other than this concern, I support this project and believe that it should continue so that wind technology will advance and create a more sustainable way of living.

January 16, 2015<br/><br/>Comments on the Environmental Assessment for Virginia Offshore Wind Technology Advancement Project on the Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf Offshore Virginia<br/>AGENCY: Bureau of Oceans Management<br/><br/>Comments:<br/>I do not oppose this project but want to be sure that it is done well, from an environmental standpoint.  This EA describes reasonably good details on many issues that need to be covered.  However there appear to be some gaps that I wish to bring to your attention that should be addressed:<br/><br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The EA report says on page 82 the applicant has proposed that pile driving will occur in May.  Then on page 109 the EA says pile driving will occur May through July.  Which is correct?  <br/><br/>2.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Please be more specific about the aviation safety lights (page 67) that will be used.  These need to be the most bird-friendly aviation safety lights known, which should be based on studies that have been supported by US Fish and Wildlife Service.  My understanding is that white strobe lights are the least likely to attract birds during inclement weather (which is when this issue is most critical).  This should be explicitly stated in the EA, and required in the turbine procurement specifications.<br/><br/>3.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>It is important that Dominion Virginia Power carry out post-construction monitoring during operation of the project to evaluate actual impacts from the wind turbines on birds, as stated on page 67. Post-construction monitoring is important to verify whether a problem really exists, to improve impact predictions from future scaling-up of wind power development in the area, and to guide any adaptive management that might be warranted. The EA should specify how the findings from post-construction monitoring would be used to improve operation of the wind turbine facility, as needed.  BOEM should require Dominion Virginia Power to make all the post-construction monitoring data readily available to the public.<br/><br/>4.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>There appear to be some contradictions between the EAs description of the onshore impact area from all onshore construction activities (Section 3.2.4.2, page 71) versus the photo shown at:  https://www.dom.com/corporate/what-we-do/electricity/generation/wind/virginia-offshore-wind-technology-advancement-project.  Specifically, in this photo (section titled Onshore Interconnection), the cable right-of-way appears to be cutting through a forested area and a wetland. Meanwhile, the EA (Section 3.2.7.2, page 122) states that no clearing of native vegetation is expected during construction along the route of the onshore cables. Which version is correct?<br/><br/>5.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Please describe in more detail the vegetation and the land cover of the onshore impact area.  <br/><br/>6.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>O

I think the VA offshore research for wind turbines is a great idea!  I&#39;ve seen the wind farms in the Midwest and have actually stood underneath and they are amazingly quiet and beautiful, set in surroundings between farms.  Are there any complaints from the surrounding property owners?  You can never satisfy everyone. Small steps will bring big success to keeping our future and earth for the generations to come. Two thumbs up!!

What a wonderful proposal!  As a resident of the Hampton Roads area of Virginia, I have long awaited the movement of alternative energy sources, especially at the coastal areas of our country.  While studying Environmental Science 20 years ago, energy alternatives were in the spot-light, yet so little has been done in this time frame to take advantage of the wind, solar, and hydrological resources available to us.  Growing up in Southern New Jersey, Atlantic Electric took a giant leap by installing 5 wind turbines on Atlantic City&#39;s skyline and they&#39;ve been going strong for many years.  When my husband was stationed over-seas in England eight years ago, wind farms were vast spread across the country-side and shore lines....not to mention throughout other areas of Europe.  I commend these efforts to get our country out of the &quot;stone-ages&quot; of producing energy.  I say &quot;kudos&quot; to Virginia for stepping up and look forward to the Hampton Roads area being a leader in the wind energy market.

Dear Program Manager:<br/><br/>As a coastal resident, I am pleased that clean energy exploration is being considered off the Virginia shore.  As a result of offshore farms, countries like England and Denmark are setting generation records.  In Denmark last year wind produced 39% of energy consumed.  Meanwhile, with the exception of a small, scaled floating turbine in Maine, the US, has no significant offshore wind capacity.  <br/><br/>The twin turbine demonstration project is essential to investigate the potential costs and consequences of developing large-scale farms.  The environmental assessment is sufficient for this small -scale project and should be approved so that we can begin to transition away from polluting and water intensive conventional energy forms. <br/><br/>In addition to reducing our carbon footprint and protecting water resources, wind has proven to be a resilient energy resource.  During extreme events like drought, heat waves, storms and even tsunamis, when conventional power has shut down, wind continues to supply energy. <br/><br/>Theres no question that we need this energy source.  And in general the public supports it.  A Harvard scientist found that nearly 90% of Americans want to see more solar and wind energy added to the U.S. landscape.<br/><br/>Lastly, offshore wind development brings industry and high paying jobs.   With the potential upside provided by offshore wind development, we cannot fail to investigate. <br/><br/>Please see that the environmental review process is expedited.<br/>

First of all wind turbines may be outdated very early due to advances in solar power and fusion energy.  Wind turbines are very expensive and have a short life expectancy.  They cause trouble for the navy and ocean going ships.  They also kill far too many birds.  There are less expensive and more serviceable ways to generate power.  We do not need wind turbises.

This is the time to venture into harnessing wind energy for Virginia and the entire Atlantic Coast.  The energy is always there, miles off the East Coast and it is right to form a plan and begin construction to convert that wind into usable energy in the form of electricity.  The ocean is a vast environment and has plenty of room for such a project.  I look forward to the development and employment of wind turbines off our coast and the flow of pollution free electricity to the citizens of Virginia and other coastal states.

1. Table 2 of the VOWTAP EA indicates a projection of  up to 464,000 km and 75,000 hrs of geophysical survey lines along the Atlantic Coast.  This represents an invaluable opportunity to deploy ship-board profiling wind Lidar units to collect data for resource assessment and model validation.  These data sets would be invaluable in reducing uncertainty for AEP estimates and improving numerical weather prediction models for day-ahead production forecasts and for vessel operation (O&amp;M) planning and safety.  Recent research at UMBC has confirmed the feasibility of ship-board Lidar deployment for weather model validation. See attached white paper for a discussion of the methodology, experiment and results.<br/><br/>2. As a general comment, I would stress that the risks and impacts to marine mammals from geophysical surveys for OSW development are much lower than O&amp;G exploration and development since O&amp;G requires much deeper bottom penetration and much higher sound pressure levels.   I strongly support development of OSW and oppose O&amp;G development for this and many other reasons.  <br/><br/>3.   Section 3.1.1.6 - No Action Plan.  Even though this is only an EA, it would be great to see a preliminary estimate of reduction in annual CO2 emissions with the project, which would not occur under the No Action Plan.

There appears to be total disregard for many studies that conclude that OffShore Wind Projects require more costs in maintenance than any savings that are realized. But yet you crusade on with a determination that befits the renown Crusaders from 700 years ago who finally determined after all of the anguish that peace was less expensive. So, why cannot you first of all tell the truth about total maintenance and who will be expected to pick up the costs of it all. Second, tell about the ignored studies that point to a positive return on the monies spent with the installation of smaller &quot;fans&quot; that can be installed on top of buildings, television and telecommunication towers, even existing TVA towers.<br/>Your total disregard is obvious and so noted.<br/>

Virginia Beach&#39;s economy is linked exactly to the environment and its health - from offshore fishing that feeds both locals and visitors to the beaches that make our homes worth so much money, provide a tax base through assessment of property value to the sunbathers who flock our stores and restaurants, parks and bike trails - the environment is the draw.  Virginia Beach because of its location and dependence on the environment should be leading the way on sustainability and alternative energy sources.  Oil may be plentiful and cheap but the downside and the potential to cripple our billion dollar tourist trade is too valuable to jeopardize.  That might be okay for the gulf coast but no one goes to a beach with tar balls and dead dolphins.  One accident from profit first companies located outside of the Commonwealth and we will lose decades in economic recovery.<br/><br/>Wind turbines are the sensible solution and we wouldn&#39;t even be discussing their merits it if it weren&#39;t for the money in politics from the well established oil conglomerates still pushing last century technologies.  There may be money in it for them to gain and politicians willing to do their bidding for their campaign coffers, but there is more money in it for Virginia Beach to lose, a lot and it affects us all not just the questionable politician or some CFO&#39;s salary.  For our children, our food, our livelihoods, and our health wind turbines and solar energy are not only beneficial, they are real solutions to the consistent and persistent byproduct of our old dirty energy sources.

Dear BOEM Officials:<br/><br/>Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the Environmental Assessment (EA) for the Virginia Offshore Wind Technology Project (VOWTAP). While I support Dominion&#39;s two test turbine project, such development must be done in a way that ensures robust protections for marine mammals and sea turtles, in particular for the North American right whale (NARW). <br/><br/>In order to support a Finding of No Significant Issues (FONSI), BOEM must amend the final EA to include the following measures:<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>prohibit pile-driving during the NARWs peak migratory season from Nov. 1 to April 30<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>during that time, place a uniform 10-knot speed limit restriction on all vessels of any length affiliated with the VOWTAP project<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>provide for a minimum of four qualified observers located at the pile driving site<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>require the developer to use the best commercially available technology to reduce noise associated with construction of the VOWTAP project<br/><br/>I applaud BOEM&#39;s efforts to bring clean renewable offshore wind power online as soon as possible. The crisis we face with climate change demands it. We in Virginia are especially vulnerable to its impacts with our Hampton Roads area being second only to New Orleans in its vulnerability to sea level rise.<br/><br/>From the VOWTAP project, critical information and &quot;lessons learned&quot; can be gleaned that can facilitate Dominion&#39;s timely build-out of its adjacent commercial lease area. We urge BOEM to work closely with Dominion and other project developers to facilitate build-out of the commercial lease area as soon as practicable, getting a substantial amount of wind power in operation no later than 2020. <br/><br/>Finally, offshore wind development can provide a valuable compliance tool in meeting Virginia&#39;s obligations under the EPA&#39;s Clean Power Plan - assuming it comes on line in a timely manner. <br/><br/>Thank you again for this opportunity to comment.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>[387 Virginia residents - see attached pdf]<br/>

As a Norfolk resident living near the beach, I am glad to hear of the potential wind technology project. We should be using the wind and waves to generate energy rather than depending on any foreign oil. Wind, wave, and sun technologies might lead to peace in the world and a much cleaner, healthier planet.

Comments on DG-5027 (RG 5.12 Rev. 1)<br/>Regulatory Position C.1 covers the selection and use of locks to protect National Security Information, Restricted Data, and Formally Restricted Data and references 10 CFR 95.25(a).  <br/>10 CFR 95.25(a) states:<br/>(a) Secret matter, while unattended or not in actual use, must be stored in--<br/>(1) A safe, steel file cabinet, or safe-type steel file container that has an automatic unit locking mechanism. All such receptacles will be accorded supplemental protection during non-working hours; or<br/>(2) Any steel file cabinet that has four sides and a top and bottom (all permanently attached by welding, rivets, or peened bolts so the contents cannot be removed without leaving visible evidence of entry) and is secured by a rigid metal lock bar and an approved key operated or combination padlock. The keepers of the rigid metal lock bar must be secured to the cabinet by welding, rivets, or bolts, so they cannot be removed and replaced without leaving evidence of the entry.

In response to 80 FR 53, FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Company (FENOC) has reviewed the draft regulatory guide (RG), and appreciates the opportunity to provide the following comments.<br/> <br/>The draft RG indicates that only the Federal Specification FF-L-2740 model X-09 lock is currently being produced.  Industry information indicates a subsequent Model X-10 is now in production that should be evaluated for inclusion in this regulatory guide.<br/><br/>Starting on page 5 of the RG, with the reference number for Federal Specification FF-L-2740, reference numbers are incorrect.  For example, Federal Specification FF-L-2740 is identified as reference 11, but Federal Specification FF-L-2740A is actually reference 12. Reference 11 is Lock Industry Standards and Training Council,  The Professional Locksmith Dictionary, 2006.<br/> <br/>2. Should you have any questions or comments, please contact:<br/><br/>H.

DOCKET NUMBER NRC-2013-0178 Byron Nuclear Power Plant Relicensing<br/><br/>I oppose the license renewal for the Byron Plant because it is a not environmentally sound and is a serious threat to human health and safety. <br/><br/>I am a 72 year old male retiree, residing ca. 20 miles south-southwest of the facility. I have family members--including children--living 5-10 miles from the plant and I fear for their health and safety. Research reveals increased cancer risk for those living within 10 miles of nuclear power plants and other studies show that nuclear workers have a greater risk of cancer than the survivors of Hiroshima/Nagasaki bombings in WWII. Nuclear power plants emit radiation daily and more serious releases occur during refueling.<br/><br/>There is no safe level of radiation. The health consequences of exposure to continued low levels are  worse than one high level exposure. <br/><br/>Exelon&#39;s competence in operating Byron is questionable, as indicated in &quot;Toxic Management Erodes Safety at &#39;World&#39;s Safest&#39; Nuclear Plant&quot; by Dreux Richard (The Japan Times, March 11, 2013). The allegations in this article have not been adequately or publicly addressed by Exelon or the NRC in my estimation, and the suggestion by the NRC Public Relations staff  that I dig through reams of documents to see if the situation was adequately dealt with leaves me cold. An associate of mine was a career employee at Byron who took early retirement out of frustration and disgust, stating, &quot;Nuclear power is fine--if its done right.&quot;  (And also indicates that most of the above mentioned ariticle is true). <br/><br/>I recommend tthat the NRC institute policies and procedures to assure that Exelon and other plant operators maintain management practices that do not intimidate employees who are trying to ensure safe operation of nuclear power plants, and to inform the public of violations of said policies and remediation of said violations.  Toxic management does not assure safety for the health of the environment, the public, and staff.<br/><br/>The alternatives to the renewal of the Byron license are clear and viable: Wind, solar and other renewable energy sources are now environmentally and economically sound. It is time to let this Nuclear Neanderthal technology die a hopefully swift death.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>

We are just very suspicious of the use of nuclear energy facilities.  It seems that we only become concerned after a disaster occurs.  There have been several nuclear accidents and numerous radiation health problems to workers and civilians.  It certainly is not a renewable source of energy, nor green!   We really need to invest in solar and wind energy.   We don&#39;t really trust Excelon.  Profit over serving the public.

On behalf of UCS, I submitted FOIA/PA-2015-0082 seeking Final Safety Analysis Report records received after October 1, 2001, by the NRC from all nuclear plant owners, including the Byron licensee. By letter dated January 7, 2015, the NRC administratively closed my request. By email dated December 30, 2014, the NRC staff notified me that the estimated page count for the requested records was 448,000 just from Region IV. That email estimated approximately 4,000 pages per FSAR per reactor with multiple updates per reactor since October 1, 2001 -- accounting for the hundreds of thousands of pages per region. <br/><br/>By withholding this vast quantity of FSAR material from the public, the NRC is significantly impairing our ability to review and comment on licensing request such as this one for Byron. The FSARs describe the safety-related structures, systems, and components at the plant and further describe their role in preventing or mitigating design basis transients and accidents. <br/><br/>NRC regulation 10 CFR 50.59 requires licensees to screen proposed modifications and changes to plant operating procedures to see whether the proposed changes might reduce safety margins approved by the NRC in a significant way. If so, the changes cannot be made until after the NRC reviews and formally approves them. The 10 CFR 50.59 screenings and evaluations rely heavily on information in the FSARs. The FSARs are also extensively used by NRC&#39;s reviewers when evaluating licensee requests for licensing actions.<br/><br/>As stated above, by withholding hundreds of thousands of pages of FSARs from the public, the NRC is significantly impairing our ability to participating in licensing proceedings in a meaningful away. The licensees and the NRC staff rely heavily on the FSAR information while preparing and reviewing requests for licensing actions, but the NRC&#39;s withholding prevents the public from reviewing this information. <br/><br/>The hundreds of thousands of pages of vital information being withheld by the NRC staff is being done so improperly. Entire FSARs, such as the recent updates for Beaver Valley Unit 2 and Watts Bar Unit 2, were made publicly available by the NRC in their entirety. This demonstrates that FSARs do not contain classified, safeguards, or sensitive information that must be withheld from public disclosure. <br/><br/>The NRC should not approve this licensing request at Byron until after the agency makes all the FSAR information for Byron publicly available and gives the public sufficient time to review this information. Failing to do so transforms this licensing process into a mockery of justice.

I recommend that a level of prevailing severy level (high, medium or low) be added to the HPMS &quot;Cracking %&quot; reporting requirement to be used as one of the pavement condition rating threshold in the regulation. This will help better describe the severity of the cracking present in each HPMS reporting section ( 0.1 mile in lenght), therefore resulting in a more accurate assessment of the actual pavement condition in each HPMS reproting section.  For example, a HPMS section may have less than 5% of cracking on the surface but the severity of that cracking may be high based on prevaling standards, while another HPMS section may have 20% cracking with low severity. For me the section with &lt; 5% cracking may be consider poor based on the severity of its cracking instead of good based on the current criteria included in the proposed regulation.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>

Some comments on Pavement Condition Measures<br/><br/>International Roughness Index (IRI) has long been part of the HPMS but as a measure of roughness, it should not be the sole pavement performance measure.<br/><br/>In or around 1995 a pavement was rated as poor if the IRI was greater than 220 but this was for the non-interstate routes whereas the threshold for the interstate routes was set at 170.  Reference past issues of Highway Statistics to find this metric.  Now the proposal is to set the threshold at 170 outside of all urban areas that have less than one million population and then at 220 inside the urban areas that have more than one million population for the non-interstate NHS.  A pavement with an IRI between 170 and 220 may be rough but it is not necessarily in need of rehabilitation or maintenance.  A PCI rating may be a better indicator of that since it has to do with condition and not only roughness.<br/><br/>According to the statewide Local Streets and Roads needs assessment done in California, about 80-90% of the pavement ratings are done in PCI (Pavement Condition Index) or similar, which is pretty much all the cities and counties that reported to the needs assessment survey. <br/><br/>But how many agencies measure IRI?  It is principally the state DOT that has to assume this responsibility.  <br/><br/>The burden and time and cost of measuring the IRI on all of the NHS and the samples of minor arterial and collector streets seems to be a greater challenge than collecting PCI from the MPOs.  PCI is almost always easier to obtain and less costly than IRI and PCI is standardized under the specification ASTM D 6433 (2007).<br/><br/>As for the HPMS connection, PSR is reported in the HPMS and PCI can be converted to PSR.  This is not to say that it isnt as easy to create one more data item and report the PCI.<br/><br/>In 2014 dollars, California has to spend 3-4 million annually to collect the IRI.  The faulting, rutting and cracking will be about another 1-2 million annually.  Nationally, this could run $40-50 million every year to comply with the reporting for the IRI, faulting, rutting and cracking along with the person-hours of contract administration since most of this work is done under contract.<br/><br/>It may be worthwhile to reexamine the business case for using PCI as a pavement performance measure.<br/>

My recommendation is to incorporate a clause into this rule that promotes the support of small businesses across the nation, within each state and county, so as to encourage the economic growth within each region that will already be given a boost if this rule is passed due to the increase in demand for civil contractors as well as the new positions the DOT will be required to hire in support of the inspection and construction accounting associated with each new project.  I believe it is imperative that this new rule doesnt end up catering to the Oligopoly or even Monopoly that the exists with the big general contractors such as Las Vegas Asphalt Paving in Las Vegas, NV who currently consumes the majority of asphalt paving in Clark County.  Furthermore, some level of marketing for the availability of this type of work to current small business general contractors should be included for this feat.  <br/>I fully support this new proposed rule as it takes a major step in the right direction to correcting the overload of renovations and new roads and bridges that this growing nation requires.  I support the initiative to enable the DOT as the enforcer and authority to issue fines to those regions who are in violation of this new rule.  I also support the given target time periods for renovations as reasonable.  The 2-4 year period is more than sufficient, as long as the language is explicit in that reasonable time be allotted for weather delays or other uncontrollable circumstances so that no fines be levied for such delays.  I do feel that the cost benefits might be a bit understated.  Certainly places that are experiencing high traffic volumes that are given funding for the widening of the roads or where new bridges provide access quicker to areas will benefit the local economies as well the social mentality from lessening their daily commute.  Not to mention the superordinate goal of keeping cars on the road less to bring down CO2 emissions.  <br/><br/>

One of the most critical problems in asphalt pavement construction today is achieving a long lasting longitudinal joint. It is costing agencies billions worldwide in premature repair of the joint. This problem has been recognized for a couple of decades, and discussed at many asphalt pavement seminars, the subject of much research, with little or no progress in many jurisdictions.<br/><br/>The problem stems from a lack of density on the edge of the first paved lane, as the compactor has nothing to compact against. This results in a push sideways at the edge, and a lack of compacted density on the outer 3-6 inches, typically 4-6 per cent less than the density of the mat. This lack of density, according to considerable research, can translate into a reduction of 20-35% in the life of a pavement, because a low density means more water penetration, more freeze thaw action, more moisture deterioration of the bitumen/aggregate bond. Further, it means a lower strength that is not capable of withstanding todays heavy traffic loads, and once the crack occurs, a concentration of load on each side of the crack as the wheel passes over, to further stress the joint area. <br/><br/>Historically, paving contractors were able to produce a better joint by limiting the length of a paved lane, moving back and matching the joint while reasonably hot. With traffic control making short paved lanes impractical, plus the advent of multi lane highways, moving back to match the warm joint has been all but eliminated on highways. Hence, a lack of density and water impermeability, and early deterioration of the joint.<br/>In a 2012 Asphalt Institute/Federal Highways Report: Best Practices for Constructing and Specifying HMA Longitudinal Joint, a 2002 Kentucky Transportation Center quote is provided :&quot; Many pavements have been, or are in the process of being, resurfaced as a direct or indirect result of longitudinal joint deteriorations. This statement is relevant today. <br/><br/>The report also cites an FHWA Division Office survey: half the respondents were not satisfied with the overall performance of longitudinal joints in their states. Thirty-five (35) states said they had some sort of longitudinal joint specification or special provision, but only half of those states (17) reported that they had a minimum density requirement at the joint. &quot;The minimum density required was as low as 89% leaving the pavement with a 35% reduction in life.  <br/><br/>Some states have actually specified that any quality control cores must be taken certain distances from the joint since it would not represent mat densities, and have no requirement to test the joint.  <br/><br/>The AI/FHWA study just covered the United States. The same problem exists in Canada, and worldwide. <br/><br/>With the serious lack of funding to continue maintaining our infrastructure, it becomes critical that this longitudinal joint construction problem be eliminated, so our roads can last longer. <br/><br

One aspect of the pavement performance measures that should be considered is the exposure and risk factors associated with the rated conditions.  That is, the specified performance conditions should be the minimum allowable condition at any time on the Interstate System.  For example, after spring thaws or periods of significant inclement weather which has recently  happened over a large extent of the US, potholes can become frequent and can have a dramatic impact on safety based on their severity and the time of exposure to traffic. <br/><br/>The rationale described here is that good roads do not pothole, but poorer roads can receive good ratings if temporary repairs are made just prior to the annual evaluations.  The &quot;actual&quot; good roads will not incur the same exposure risk as will the &quot;poorer&quot; roads which rated good.  The current procedures appear to be based on annual assessments that only characterize the roadway at that moment in time and hence cannot account for the exposure risk.  This does not ensure the safety of the interstate system.<br/><br/>In addition to establishing a minimum condition goal, it might also be useful to look at other strategies to discriminate between a good road and a poorer road that rates good.  Although strategies like evaluating areas of localized roughness in profile evaluations could help delineate this issue, it would be labor intensive.  Perhaps using traffic as probe vehicles with a call in number for unacceptable road conditions could perform as a check on the current system and could be used as a means to require supplemental evaluations or actually to trump the annual evaluations and to change the rating.  There could also be another category of performance measure which would require repair of &quot;extreme conditions&quot; to ensure safety and minimize exposure.<br/><br/>During the several years that  these performance standards will be integrated into working practice, in-vehicle communications with the infrastructure are also being developed by the auto manufacturers and in the not to distant future traffic streams can be used to characterize the interstate system for the occurrences of unacceptable roadway conditions.

The FHWA determination that this rule making would not affect a taking of private property ( EO 12630 Taking of Private Property ) is not considering that repaving and certain pavement maintenance activities requires bringing facilities in conformance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA).  Often ROW is required for these upgrades, and the cost of ADA facility upgrades can often exceed the costs of the repaving activities alone.  Section 1B of EO 12630 requires &quot;Executive departments and agencies should review their actions carefully to prevent unnecessary takings and should account in decision-making for those takings that are necessitated by statutory mandate&quot;. The EO 12630 preamble states &quot;in order to ensure that government actions are undertaken on a well-reasoned basis with due regard for fiscal accountability, for the financial impact of the obligations imposed on the Federal government&quot;. I am concerned that ADA ROW &amp; Facility Costs that are part of the asset maintenance costs, are omitted from the assessment and actual financial and hourly burdens (Paperwork Reduction Act) for implementing the rulemaking, and will be actually much larger than the rulemaking predicts. These increased costs may invoke violation of the Unfunded Mandates Reform<br/>Act of 1995 despite FHWA declaring the rulemaking would not. <br/><br/>I suspect &quot;lack of funding&quot; will be cited as why pavement and bridge assets were allowed to decline. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 states &quot;in the absence of full consideration by Congress, of Federal mandates on State, local, and tribal<br/>governments without adequate funding, in a manner that may displace other essential governmental priorities; and to ensure that the Federal Government pays the costs incurred by those governments in complying&quot;. In the rulemaking, FHWA speaks of imposing financial penalties for non-compliance. If an asset owner cannot fiscally meet physical requirements of the rulemaking, how does this not invoke the situation that Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 addresses?<br/><br/>ADA was not mentioned in this rulemaking, and I believe needs to be.<br/><br/>TNS

A major issue with the pavement performance measure of IRI has been difficulty of measuring it with typical technology at speeds of 35 mph or less and unders top and start conditions.<br/><br/>The University of California Pavement Research Center has recently been evaluating a new Smart Car mounted profiler developed by SSI that is capable of measuring IRI at slow speeds and it appears that filters can added that will produce clean profiles and IRI values under stop and start conditions.<br/><br/>This advance in technology, which is likely under development by other technology providers, will allow local government to have IRI measured on their routes.<br/><br/>Why does IRI matter for local government?  Roughness affects rider comfort, but more importantly it affects vehicle fuel economy, particularly for heavy trucks moving at slow speeds according to recently -recalibrated HDM4 models reported in NCHRP Report 720 (work done by Michigan State University).

The American Association of Immunologists (AAI), the largest professional association of immunologists in the world, representing more than 7,600 basic and clinical immunologists, appreciates this opportunity to submit comments to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Request for Information (RFI): Identifying and Reducing Regulatory Burden.  AAI is pleased that the USDA has initiated this effort, since regulatory burden is a significant barrier to the productivity and efficiency of the nations scientific researchers. <br/><br/>In their research, AAI members use and depend on animals and therefore have a deep interest in all matters governing their care and use.  AAI appreciates that the USDA is seeking ways to ensure the humane care and use of animals without unnecessarily or inadvertently reducing scientific research capacity or disrupting, impeding, or burdening the research scientists who spend their careers in search of answers and cures.  <br/><br/>AAI members are funded by a wide range of federal agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH); the Department of Defense (DOD); the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA); the USDA; the Department of Energy (DOE); and the National Science Foundation (NSF).  Many members receive grants from multiple agencies over the course of their careers.  As a result, AAI hopes that issues identified and addressed by USDA will spur action by, and coordination among, the many federal science agencies to reduce investigators regulatory burdens. <br/><br/>In addition to our comments below, AAI urges the USDA to consider carefully the thoughtful and comprehensive comments submitted by the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB), of which AAI is a founding member, and the American Physiological Society (APS).  Both groups have offered well-reasoned suggestions for the reduction of regulatory burden. <br/><br/>  Exempt some biomedical procedures performed on agricultural animals from compliance with USDA regulations<br/>The guidelines contained in Licensing and Registration Under the Animal Welfare Act (AWA), Guidelines for Dealers, Exhibitors, Transporters, and Researchers, which were issued by the USDAs Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), specify that, [i]nstitutions using any regulated live animals for research, testing, teaching, or experimentation must register with the USDA as research facilities.  Under the guidelines, however, Agricultural Research Institutions are exempt.  These institutions include those that, perform work involving food, fiber, or agriculture and that use horses and domestic farm animals, including rabbits as long as they are not performing nonagricultural biomedical research. At institutions that perform both agricultural research and nonagricultural biomedical research, the regulations require that different animals be used for agricultural research than are used for nonagricultural biomedical research, and that these g

In fact, investigator concerns about animal pain and distress has generated  a large body of information and opinion.

These comments are submitted on behalf of the American Physiological Society.<br/><br/>Which regulations, reporting requirements, or regulatory submission or application processes are unnecessarily complicated or could be streamlined to achieve regulatory objectives in ways that are more efficient?<br/><br/>Alternatives search requirement: As currently applied, the alternatives search requirement is an inefficient and burdensome approach to Animal Welfare Act 2143(a)(3)(B). This section mandates that the Principal Investigator considers alternatives to any procedure likely to produce pain or distress in an experimental animal.  The regulatory interpretation of this section should be modified. Animal Care Policy #12 recommends a database search as the most effective and efficient method for demonstrating compliance with the requirement to consider alternatives to painful and/or distressful procedures. It further states that researchers should submit the names of the databases searched; the dates of searches; the time periods covered by the searches; and key words and specific strategies used in such searches. This requires significant effort on the part of the investigator while providing little insight into the investigators actual consideration of alternatives strategies, which are defined by Russell and Burch1 as efforts to reduce, refine, or replace potentially painful procedures.<br/><br/>We recommend that APHIS instead require a brief written narrative justifying the selection of the animal model including how reduction, refinement and/or replacement were incorporated into the consideration of animal numbers.  Such a narrative gives the review body (IACUC) much more insight into the consideration of alternatives, satisfies the regulatory objectives of the Animal Welfare Act, and reduces burden for researchers.  <br/><br/> W.M.S.

The specific guidance of APHIS Policy #3 states that the use of expired medical materials such as drugs, fluids, sutures, anesthetics, sedatives, or analgesics on regulated animals during a survival procedure is considered inadequate veterinarian care. Therefore, facilities should either dispose of all such materials or segregate them in an appropriately labeled, physically separate location from non-expired medical materials.

Public Comments on the Proposed Collection of Information on the Development of Nutrition Education Messages and Products for the General Public<br/>October 7, 2015<br/><br/>On behalf of The Dannon Company, we thank you for the opportunity to submit comments regarding proposed information collection for development of nutrition education messages and products for the general public. As a leading yogurt manufacturer for more than 70 years, we are committed to bringing health through food to as many people as possible. In addition, we recognize and appreciate the important work of the USDA CNPP in developing nutrition education messages and resources that support the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.<br/><br/>Collection of consumer feedback in development of nutrition education messaging is a critical step toward ensuring that the messages developed are practical, actionable, simple and specific, and may hopefully help result in Americans shifting to healthier dietary habits including the consumption of more nutrient dense foods. Research should include efforts to determine message actionability that motivates behavior change in order to have the greatest practical utility both at the individual level as well as from a broader public health population perspective. We agree that the proposed consumer research should address both general population and special population groups as mentioned in the federal register notice, with the following thoughts for additional consideration. <br/><br/>While general population insights and messages are needed, specific target groups as mentioned in the Federal Register (including low-income consumers, children, older Americans, educators and students) are important audiences. We also believe that the inclusion of ethnic populations  as food choices and food behaviors vary greatly among ethnic cultures  would provide additional valuable insights. As highlighted by the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, the disparities in obesity and chronic disease rates exist not only for the low income population but are also prevalent for certain ethnic and racial groups.

These life stages are critically important groups to understand when it comes to developing nutrition education messages that are relevant, workable and that can drive scale among consumers. In addition to ethnicity/culture and life stage, household size significantly impacts food preparation behaviors. Accounting for these factors would also enhance the insights gleaned from the study.<br/><br/>In short, it would be helpful to ensure that the sample us

I am honored to submit this comment on behalf of [fourteen] nationally-recognized nutrition researchers, scientists and other public health professionals, in support of the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion&#39;s plans to undertake consumer research to test nutrition education messages and products for the general public.  We further ask that such research include testing of a symbol for water on MyPlate. Last year we urged the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee to recommend strong language in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGAs) regarding the benefits of water consumption as a beverage of choice, and they did so. Advice in the DGAs on drinking water should be translated out to the general public with a water symbol on MyPlate.<br/><br/>We all know that the American public consumes sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) in excess and that calories and added sugars from SSBs are a major contributor to the national epidemic of diabetes and overweight and obesity.  And we know that water should be promoted as a beverage of choice and as the best non-caloric substitute for SSBs.  The attached letter highlights recent evidence that confirms the advisability of supporting the language in the Guidelines with a water symbol on MyPlate, the translation of the Guidelines most often seen by children and their families.<br/>

Sir / Mam<br/>I am appalled to find out that taxpayer funds are being provided to religious institutions without the same transparency as other non-profit entities whom are non-religious.  The news has highlighted instances of church funds being used to hush women impregnated by priests, instances of financial improprieties by the Vatican Bank, and of course the infamous money shuffling by churches to avoid paying restitution to victims of pedophilia.  Why would anyone want to grant and continue special financial privileges instead of full transparency? <br/><br/>Charles Golden<br/>CGoldenFamily@gmail.com<br/>

Erosion of the bill of rights and changing of laws to benefit the few has been going on for decades. Please return us to the original intent of the first amendment. We must include the non-discrimination of workers in explicitly religious entities AND make sure evidence (symbols, signs, proselytizing to clients in any way) of their real purpose is excluded from the site of tax sponsored services, direct or indirect.<br/><br/>In fact, we could make it simple and remove ALL tax payer subsidies from religious organizations. The first amendment makes it clear there should be no support. The real estate tax exemption alone is over the top support as it is. And don&#39;t get me started about the politics from the pulpit that is illegal and rampant. I appreciate the time you take to consider things that affect so many people.<br/><br/>Regards and thank you,

Thank you for proposing that FBOs that receive federal funding must provide written notice to beneficiaries of their rights, and must refer beneficiaries who object to the FBO&#39;s religious character to a secular provider. I really don&#39;t want my tax money going to promote a religion I don&#39;t believe in.<br/><br/>I find it very disturbing that these federal funded programs are allowed to discriminate with who they hire and that they can openly display religious symbols when tax dollars are funding their services.<br/><br/>Ensuring people are free to believe whatever religion they want is one of the fundamental and core values of America.  And ensuring that the christian majority in our country doesn&#39;t trample on the freedom of others is an important protection to maintain.  Please make sure that these types of organizations are not able to receive indirect funding from tax payers either, through the use of voucher programs for example.  We need to protect future generations from the bigotry and intolerance that majority religions often promote.

I would encourage the USDA to strengthen oversight and educational opportunities of religious entities to ensure they are keeping their religious activities separate from USDA funded programs.

Equal Opportunity for Religious Organizations in USDA Programs: Implementation of E.O.13559 <br/>RIN 0503-AA55 <br/>Ms. Norah Deluhery, Director <br/>Center for Faith-Based: and Neighborhood Partnerships <br/>U.S. Department of Agriculture <br/>1400 Independence Ave., SW <br/>Washington, DC  20250 <br/>Dear Ms. Deluhery: <br/>The Georgia Food Bank Association is comprised of 8 Feeding America Food Banks who distributed more than 121 million pounds of food through a statewide network of 2,500 partner agencies and pantries in Georgia last year.  156,500 clients receive emergency food assistance from our network every WEEK.  We are a member of the Feeding America network of 200 food banks and 58,000 local agencies. We appreciate the opportunity to comment on this important rulemaking.  While most of the food we provide comes from private donations, we are very grateful for the food and financial support we receive from USDA.  USDA foods are extremely nutritious and highly sought after by clients, agencies and food banks alike. <br/>Many of the provisions in the proposed rulemaking are a reiteration of existing policy, such as the importance of separating any religious activities from the provision of federal resources, and the requirement that that our beneficiaries not be required to participate in any religious activities as a condition of receiving federal assistance.  These types of requirements are well understood by the food bank and the agencies we support and are a point of emphasis in frequent training sessions. <br/>Nationally, our network relies heavily on volunteers and on Faith Based organizations.  Of the 54,000 agencies supplied by food banks, 51% are staffed only by volunteers, and 62% are Faith-Based organizations.  In Georgia, that figure is higher:  74% of our partner agencies are faith based with more than 60% run by volunteers.  In rural areas of our state, the faith based pantries are the only organizations working in food assistance.  Thus it is critically important that we not over-burden our volunteers, nor discourage Faith-Based organizations from continuing support hungry families and individuals.   <br/>The new requirements regarding referrals of beneficiaries to other potential providers are an area of significant concern to us and to most food banks.  Our comments in this regard fall into two categories.  First, we believe that our work in providing meals and food for home consumption meets the definition of USDA indirect assistance. Our rationale is provided in the following paragraph.  Second, should USDA choose to categorize this work as USDA direct assistance we would ask that several provisions be clarified or made more explicit. <br/>Both the proposed rule and the Supreme Court decision cited in the preamble use as the principle distinction between direct and indirect federal assistance whether the beneficiary of the service has the ability to choose the provider of such services.  In the case of Federal Food Prog

If an agency accepts taxpayer money, they must hire their employees based on merit, not on the applicant&#39;s belief or non-belief in the &quot;faith&quot; of the organization. I have stopped donating to the Salvation Army, and any other religious charity, because of this violation of the First Amendment.<br/>I disagree that the charity may have religious icons and symbols in the same space where they provide services--this constitutes government endorsement of that religion, and would make an adherent of a different religion feel unwelcome or at worst intimidated--no crucifixes, no Torahs, no Korans. <br/>All the donations I used to make to &quot;faith-based&quot; charities are now going to Planned Parenthood, where people of every, any, or no religion, are made to feel welcome.

Dear Sirs,<br/><br/>Thank you for proposing that FBOs that receive federal funding must provide written notice to beneficiaries of their rights, and must refer beneficiaries who object to the FBO&#39;s religious character to a secular provider. I also urge you to require that these reforms be applied to FBOs that receive federal funding through a voucher program or other &quot;indirect&quot; means. Federal funds should never be used to promote religion.<br/><br/>While the proposed rules help to prevent FBOs from using taxpayer dollars to promote religion, they do not go far enough. As a U.S. taxpayer and citizen, I am strongly opposed to allowing FBOs to discriminate in their hiring, and to display religious symbols where federally funded services are offered.<br/><br/>Please add my concerns to the proposed changes.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Bob Jochums, Pharm.D.<br/>3440 Kingsland Circle<br/>Berkeley Lake, GA  30096-6170

Firstly, I do not want one penny of my taxpaying dollars to be spent on Faith-based organizations.  Secondly, if this new regulation passes then the fbos should play by federal rules and not discriminate against anyone.

Hello, and thank you for reading my letter.<br/><br/>Thank you for proposing that FBOs that receive federal funding must provide written notice to beneficiaries of their rights, and must refer beneficiaries who object to the FBO&#39;s religious character to a secular provider. The bait and switch has to stop, beneficiaries should never be subjected to overt or indirect religious proseletyzing simply to receive what is lawfully theirs.<br/><br/>I also am urging you to require that these reforms be applied to FBOs that receive federal funding through a voucher program or other &quot;indirect&quot; means. Federal funds should never be used to promote religion.  As a taxpayer, I am sick and tired of supporting this or that variation of the invisible Sky Daddy.<br/><br/>While the proposed rules help to prevent FBOs from using taxpayer dollars to promote religion, they do not go far enough. As a U.S. taxpayer and citizen, I am STRONGLY OPPOSED to allowing FBOs to discriminate in their hiring, and to display religious symbols where federally funded services are offered.<br/><br/>Thanks<br/>Jay

I strongly support the complete separation of government from religion and encourage your agency to oppose government support of, or to adopt strengthened accountability provisions concerning, &quot;faith-based organizations (FBOs)&quot;.  Specifically, FBOs receiving federal assistance must be prohibited from the display of &quot;religious articles, texts, art, or symbols&quot; in the spaces where they deliver federally funded services and must be treated like all other service providers or employers under federal law provisions and never discriminate in their hiring, or provision of services on the basis of bases of race, color, national origin, age, disability, sex, gender identity, religion, reprisal, and where applicable, political beliefs, marital status, familial or parental status, or sexual orientation.<br/>Sincerely,<br/>Mark Keiserman<br/>

Thank you for proposing that FBOs that receive federal funding must provide written notice to beneficiaries of their rights, and must refer beneficiaries who object to the FBO&#39;s religious character to a secular provider. I also urge you to require that these reforms be applied to FBOs that receive federal funding through a voucher program or other &quot;indirect&quot; means. Federal funds should never be used to promote religion.<br/><br/>While the proposed rules help to prevent FBOs from using taxpayer dollars to promote religion, they do not go far enough. As a U.S. taxpayer and citizen, I am strongly opposed to allowing FBOs to discriminate in their hiring, and to display religious symbols where federally funded services are offered.<br/><br/>Your consideration of these issues is greatly appreciated.

I object to the glaring omission of any prohibition against FBOs discriminating in their hiring on the basis of religion. By &quot;blessing&quot; such a rule, the Obama Administration is approving, for instance, discrimination in the use of federal funds against LGBTQ applicants, or against an unmarried pregnant woman, or against an applicant who is an atheist or the &quot;wrong religion.&quot; If an FBO accepts federal funds, it should have to play by federal rules. If, as a service provider or as an employer, an FBO is unwilling to open its doors to nonadherentsincluding religious minorities and the 23% of adult Americans who are nonreligiousthat FBO should not be offered public funds.<br/>I also oppose the proposed rule allowing FBOs to display &quot;religious articles, texts, art, or symbols&quot; in the spaces where they deliver federally funded services. Beneficiaries of federally funded services will reasonably understand the government to endorse any religious messages or symbols in the area where the services are delivered. Just as a government entity cannot place religious iconography or messages on its walls, FBOs should be required to remove these symbols at the time and location they provide federally funded services. Beneficiaries in need should not be subjected to religious messages that conflict with their own beliefs in order to receive federally funded services.

In regard to rule changes implementing Executive Order 13559 regulation of faith-based organizations (FBOs), I see only a violation of the establishment clause. This is a Presidents personal belief system injected into secular government to provide subsidy to FBOs, and my taxes go to promoting religion.  FBO provided aid, subsidized by the government, is simply another diversion of government funds to religion.<br/><br/>FBOs administrated by government agencies have no real and verifiable use of funds or activitiesa religious privilege and a blind-eye approach are unacceptable. Is an FBO required to provide assistance not in agreement with their religious beliefs, especially were the FBO the only reasonably available provider? The same as a County Clerk refusing to perform her secular job requirements, FBOs are restricted in what they provide in aid to others by their faith. FBOs therefore will not treat all equally under the lawconsider vociferous conservative Christian beliefs against LGBT and womens rights. Such beliefsunsubstantiated as they areare inherent to the aid they provide. Their beliefs cannot be government subsidized.<br/><br/>The very genesis of religion is to promote religious beliefsunsubstantiated beliefs. FBO motivated aid is a sectarian statement; in effect telling recipients that you are receiving this aid because of our god(s) or religious beliefs. This is proselytizing, and NO rule made by our government agencies funding FBO aid negates that. Why should I be forced to fund growth of FBO motivated aid?<br/><br/>Please cease funding sectarian religious charitable bents with my taxes. FBO regulation is undermining the governments secular obligation to help all citizens without regard to religion. Whereas, religious individuals can work for and support secularly administered government aid programsunless were it because of their sincerely held religious beliefscharity doled out by religious organizations, funded by everyones tax dollars, is endorsement of religion. Stop entangling religion with our governments aid programs.<br/>

I believe that the proposal to expand the membership of the U.S. Highland Blueberry Council (Council) from 16 current members to 20 members would be beneficial to the Council to accept this increase in membership.<br/>The U.S. Highbush Blueberry Council administers the Blueberry Promotion, Research and Information Order with oversight by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).  As the ultimate goal of the Council is to increase demand for highbush blueberries, the funding to attain this goal is by collection of assessments from domestic producers and importers.  The stated reason for the increase of council membership is to help guarantee that the composition of the Council reflects the geographical distribution of domestic blueberry production and imports into the United States.  Additional benefits of this proposed regulation are that the Councils nominations procedures would be further clarified, the number of members which are needed for a quorum would be increased, and eligibility requirements should be added for the public member on the council.  <br/>I believe this proposed increase in membership will better insure an increased representation amongst the varying geographical interests of the varying highland blueberry producers.  Currently the Council is largely represented by the top six blueberry producing states, each of which contribute a producer member and an alternate member.  These top six states are Michigan, Oregon, Washington, Georgia, New Jersey and California.  This proposal will add North Carolina and Florida to the Council.  I think the addition of these two states will provide for a better geographic representation on the council by adding the east coast and south east of the United States.  It would appear that currently the west coast and the northern states are represented more heavily on the Council.  Given the fact that the expenditure of tax dollars is impacted, by virtue of the USDA, it would seem that a greater representation of highland blueberry producers will be ensured by the adoption of this proposal.<br/>Along with the greater diversity of the Council that this proposal will provided to those associated with the highland blueberry industry, this proposal also aims to add a public member to the Council.  The proposal has stated that the public member not be a blueberry producer, handler, importer, exporter or have a financial interest in the production, marketing, sales or distribution of blueberries.  I believe that the addition of this public member will be advantageous for the tax paying public due to their non-partisan opinion.  The diversity component that this position on the Council will add will be advantageous to the Council and help it attain its goals.<br/>Although I would support his proposal in its entirety if necessary, I would like to see a portion of it changed.  The proposal addresses the issue of past due assessments which are payable to the Council for its funding.  The proposal i

Domtar&#39;s President and Chief Executive Officer, John D. Williams, is currently serving as the first chairman of that Board.  On behalf of my nearly 9,500 colleagues, I am pleased with the early work the Paper and Packaging Board has produced.  We look forward to the Board&#39;s continued work.<br/><br/>Understandably, the Board depends on assessments to complete its work, including assessments from certain foreign producers who import paper and packaging into the United States.  Foreign and domestic producers alike benefit from the important work of the Board as we help to sustain and grow markets for paper and paper products.  The Board needs to plan its work functions around predictable cash flow and if an assessment is late, the work of the Board can be disrupted.<br/><br/>Domtar supports the proposed late fee as outlined in the 2015-20437 Federal Register notice.<br/><br/>Sincerely, <br/><br/>Thomas S.

The proposed revision highlighted under the USDA&#39;s Agriculture Marketing Service pertains to the removal of said word, &quot;Unclassified&quot; for means of establishing a standard due to the inaccurate grading representation for such items covered under the Department of Agriculture&#39;s guidelines. Furthermore, the components of this revision offer an interpretation of the acceptable grading standards for the categories of Fresh Produce, Produce Processing, and Nut and Specialty Crop Processing. In context, the accuracy of the standards is essentially the benchmark for acquisition.  Many wholesalers, suppliers, growers, and consumers depend on the U.S. Standards for Grades, when determining the quality, consistency, and quantity. I happen to agree with the proposed revision of the standards. If the Department of Agriculture chose to vacate the proposed rule, the term &quot;Unclassified&quot; would cover items that have no former category, for reasons of obscurity. The proposed action initiates a focus on arguing that these items that are not commonalities, need to be further defined to be placed into a proposed category. <br/><br/>According to the Agricultural Marketing Service, grading standards are key indicators for industries to supply uniform information to suppliers, growers, and consumers on the size, quality, and condition of such items in the marketplace. Furthermore, it is the responsibility of the Agricultural Marketing Service to facilitate the process of acquiring these commodities through providing accurate, and informative grading standards that highlight the components aforementioned.  Informing and providing accurate grading scales provides the everyday consumer with the necessary knowledge to make informed decisions. Same principle applies to the suppliers that have available measurements to determine the perishability and inconsistency of the commodities. Many supermarket chains and specialty shops rely on the grading standards for purchasing vast quantities. <br/><br/>If the Department of Agriculture chose to not execute the eradication of &quot;Unclassified&quot; from the grading standards, both consumers and market chains would not be able to discern what items are classified under this vague generalization. It is the sole responsibility of the Department of Agriculture to determine whether the removal of the &quot;Unclassified&quot; category would essentially be beneficial for the purpose of formalizing rules that adhere to specifying standards, or if this revision would essentially backfire, causing possible backlash from corporations that use the &quot;Unclassified&quot; Grading Standard to categorize a variety of their products. Essentially, this revision presents no clear path as to which would be the correct decision, but as a clear advocate for informative and protective rights, it is wise to provide a definitive category in which items like canned and frozen produce as well as indiscernible products are given

I agree with the proposal to revise the &quot;Unclassified&quot; grades for fresh fruits and vegetables, fruits and vegetables for processing, nuts, and specialty crops. Doing this will help not only public consumers, but large buyers and suppliers as well. It will create more fluidity in the buying experience because the grades will be clearly differentiated. More people will be educated on the foods they&#39;re eating and people will also have the ability to live a healthier lifestyle.

In revising the grading standard for fresh fruits, vegetables and the like, the industry would prosper as a consequence.  As the Agricultural Marketing states: &quot;Marketing orders and agreements are industry-driven programs that help fruit, vegetable, and specialty crop producers and handlers achieve marketing success&quot; (ams.usda.gov).  Revising the amendment to remove the &quot;unclassified&quot; category would then allow for more detailed and firm categories, and would also force the produce industry to produce higher quality products.  <br/><br/>In addition to removing the &quot;unclassified&quot; standard from 46-listed food items, this revision will help keep with today&#39;s ever-changing marketing plans and standards.   The overall goal is to help buyers to better understand the separate categories that describe food quality, as well as to make produce companies more profitable.  Therefore, I agree the Agricultural Marketing Service rule revision.  <br/>

I agree with the proposed action and believe that this is necessary for the greater good. The proposed action issued by the Agricultural Marketing Services has an effect on the industry and the consumer who have dealings with the items under the category of &quot;unclassified&quot;. I believe that the removal of this category will help standardize the grading of these items and standardize the market to fit today&#39;s regulations. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>This is also good for consumers because they can trust the food they get are regulated and healthy to eat. I would feel a lot more comfortable knowing that the agriculture being produced is regulated so nothing that would affect my health would be added.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The industry would also profit from this it would help give guidelines to protect its customers and give flexibility within the regulations. This also makes a fair competitive market where one company can&#39;t monopolize the rest.<br/>

I support the proposition to revise the &quot;Unclassified&quot; grade for the fruits, vegetables, and nuts listed. Large-volume buyers indirectly support the nutrition of large groups (including schoolchildren, inmates, and armed forces); however, they depend on defined grades to discern the safety of foods and to efficiently do business. With the removal of the &quot;Unclassified&quot; grade, buyers will be able to view specific grades for these foods and buy them more easily. They will be more likely to purchase these nutritional items for their consumers. The health of all of our citizens depends on the nutrition of the food they receive, and when institutions find comfort and ease in buying healthy produce, their consumers will receive better nutrition.

Dear Sir or Madam,<br/><br/>As large grocery stores, restaurants, and other large quantity buyers purchase bulk produce it is crucial they know the quality of the food they are purchasing. Through the 46 proposed changes to the US Standards for Grades, an attempt to remove &quot;unclassified&quot; as a possible option has both positive and negative possible repercussions. If this regulation is passed. all food will be labeled. This will allow producers to grasp the quality of the food they are purchasing. <br/><br/>By knowing the quality of the food, these consumers will be informed buyers, able to make informed decisions. However, in the current situation food goes through rigorous investigation by multiple trained officials to determine the quality of the produce. In these cases the official denotes a grade to eat item. When an item does not fit any of the grades, it is determined to be &quot;unclassified&quot;. &quot;Unclassified&quot; does not mean the produce is bad, it just means the produce does not fit any of the preset standards. <br/><br/>For example, at this time, raspberries are classified as U.S No. 1, US No. 2, or &quot;unclassified&quot;. U.S No. 1 means the raspberries are &quot;well developed and not soft, overripe, or broken; which are free from cores, sunscald, mold, and decay&quot;. US No. 2 means &quot;fail to meet the requirements of the U.S. No. 1 grade but which do not contain more than 10 percent, by volume, of berries in any lot which are seriously damaged by any cause, including therein not more than 2 percent for berries which are affected by mold or decay&quot;. &quot;Unclassified&quot; raspberries do not fit either of the above categories. <br/><br/>By removing the &quot;unclassified&quot; section from raspberries, the USDA would have to determine every major variant of raspberry produce that could be of interest to the buyer. How would a raspberry batch be classified if many of the berries were overripe but none of them contained mold? How would a raspberry batch be classified if the berries were not well developed? The USDA would need to determine these difference for each of the 46 fruits, vegetables, and nuts that are under review for this policy. <br/><br/>I believe if this policy were to pass, the USDA would have to spend an enormous amount to time creating categories that apply to every piece of produce that is currently being labeled &quot;unclassified&quot;. In addition, once these new categories are made, produce could be placed in categories not because they belong there, but because there is no where else to put them. By trying to properly label these 46 foods, the USDA could end up mislabeling them. Removing &quot;unclassified&quot; as an option could cause more harm than good. I think this proposal has good intention but would not be easily executed. For this reason I recommend that &quot;unclassified&quot; stays as an option.<br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time to consider my opinion.

I do not support the proposed 20% market restriction for crop year 2015/16.  Normally I would be 100% supportive of this action but the proposal either ignores or is unaware of the new information regarding importation of significant amount of European/Turkey sourced concentrate.  It appears that over  200 million pounds of equivalent fruit is being imported.  This changes the market dynamic so significantly that a new plan needs to be created to regain market share from these imports.  By restricting the production tonnage we are actually subsidizing the imports by affording the importers higher prices.  The USA growers end up paying for the storage fees and driving grower prices down.  This is very short sited and again is not in the best interest of the growers.

I rely on organic foods (and medicines) to keep me healthy. Without it, I would NOT be able to maintain a healthy body, mind, and spirit. Every time the government (and/or private companies) increases the amount of pesticides and toxic chemicals allowed in items such as Round-up, we as a species are inviting catastrophe. These chemicals wind up in our drinking water and our farms and gardens. Then they wind up in our food - and in our bodies. How many lethal cases of cancer or other disease does it take for you to understand the gravity of your laws and decisions? Do you truly NOT understand the connection between toxic chemicals allowed in poultry feed and the (now) ineffective antibiotics? How many children need to be hospitalized for ailments that are now life-threatening due to the mis-management and mis-use of these chemicals? How many thousands of bees must die before you understand how desperately WE RELY ON THEM for so much of our food???? PLEASE remove the chemicals, do NOT allow synthetic or otherwise non-organic substances to be allowed in what gets labelled &quot;Organic&quot;! MY HEALTH depends on KNOWING what I ingest!!!!!!

The problem of growing enough food for an over-populated planet of human beings is quite complex.  To introduce organic and sustainable farming on a worldwide basis is going to produce resistance from the usual business as usual.  Yet, business as usual is poisoning numerous species and the food produced as well.  Unfortunately, Monsanto and a number of other corporate selfish interests have no altruistic motivations or sensitivity to the repercussions of their pesticides and fertilizers.  And they are quite dictatorial in their demands upon the small and large farmer to do it their way or be scrutinized and put on &#39;a defiance list&#39; of non cooperation.  This is absurd and must stop.-Robbin Zoupas

I am not a scientist, nor a farmer, but I do know that I choose to eat organic foods because I believe consuming chemicals from non-organic foods over time, is really bad for my health. Mother Nature created a healthy environment for us to use to grow food and while making improvements to her original plan is a great idea, I believe that using chemicals and pesticides to grow food is extremely dangerous both to our health, and the health of the planet.

Unfortunately, the NOSB is continuing to allow the organic label to be watered down, little by little and the organic community is hoping that you will go back to your roots and remove ingredients that have no business being used on organic crops.<br/><br/>Therefore, I urge you to incorporate the following recommendations put forth by people advocating for strengthening the organic guidelines:<br/><br/> No more synthetic methionine!  It needs to be phased out of organic poultry feed as the NOSB originally decided. Methionine is an amino acid that acts as a growth promoter (comparable to the synthetic growth promoter rGBH used in dairy cows). Unfortunately, the new proposal increases use instead of increasing space and outdoor access, and alternative feed sources without any scientific support. This is not acceptable! Neither synthetic amino acids nor synthetic growth promoters are compatible with organic practices. The phase out requires an expiration date.<br/><br/> Nonorganic agricultural ingredients in organic products should be eliminated based on health and environmental impacts and the ability to produce them organically. Documentation for decisions has been lacking, including environmental and health impacts of pesticides used in their production. Organic agriculture can now supply most, if not all, of these materials.<br/><br/> &quot;Inert&quot; ingredients really aren&#39;t inert and actually have toxic properties which should not be allowed in the organic industry. These inert ingredients in pesticides used in organic production must be individually reviewed without further delay, according to processes recommended by the NOSB. They are designed to enhance the pesticidal activity of pesticide products and can have toxic properties that do not meet the standards of the Organic Foods Production Act (OFPA). <br/><br/> No chlorine should be used on organic products. Chlorine is extremely toxic and is hazardous in its production, transportation, storage, use, and disposal. EPAs Design for the Environment has identified safer viable alternatives for some or all uses, including other materials on the National List.

Please do not allow any further dilution of Organic Standards that would expose consumers to chemicals, GMOs and manufactured pesticides and herbicides.  <br/><br/>Do not allow GMO contamination of organic crops and livestock and put in place laws which provide compensation to organic farmers whose crops are contaminated. <br/><br/>Do not let the USDA bully or coerce the NOSB into ANYTHING that will compromise existing organic standards and review all currently allowed chemicals for the necessity of inclusion in organic foods.

Organically certified de-oiled lecithin is commercially available. Clarkson Soy Products has been supplying it since mid-2013. Its quality and functionality are outstanding. We have not received a single complaint, not even one, about its performance. Processors who want to use available organic ingredients are already using it. Those who continue using conventional de-oiled lecithin are taking unfair commercial advantage over processors using organic lecithin. I suspect resistance to using available de-oiled organic lecithin comes from processors who want the benefit of organic margins while continuing to enjoy the lower cost of using conventional de-oiled lecithin processed with hexane and acetone. <br/><br/>As Clarkson Soy petitioned years ago to remove fluid lecithin from the list of organic exceptions, we were opposed by some processors who made the same claim then that they are making now about de-oiled lecithin. Fortunately, the NOSB saw through those arguments and appropriately removed fluid lecithin from the National List and gave hope to those seeking development of more organic ingredients to replace products made with toxic chemicals. At that time, we anticipated that some processors would continue to avoid buying organic lecithin by claiming they needed de-oiled lecithin. Working with consultants familiar with all lecithin uses, domestic and international, we know that there is almost no application for which fluid lecithin will not work. In a few situations, de-oiled lecithin is more convenient to use than fluid lecithin even though the functionality is identical. But convenience is not supposed to trump the use of certified organic ingredients under the NOP. <br/><br/>Given the availability of fully functional certified organic de-oiled lecithin, continued use of de-oiled conventional lecithin should end gracefully. A staged sunset is appropriate.<br/><br/>Lynn Clarkson<br/>Managing director, Clarkson Soy Products, LLC<br/>

I am  grandmother.  I strongly support the implementation of the best possible practices for agriculture and food production.  IT is essential to our health and to the health of the planet that we ban all nefarious agricultural methods that use toxins that injure people, animals, and the Earth.  I only buy organics but I want the regulations for organics to stay strong and pure, so that I can trust that the &quot;organic&quot; label reflects the truth and not be misleading, as in the case of organic companies using manure from CAFOs to fertilize their land.  Please do the right thing and protect our food supply, our health, and the Earth by holding strong in insuring that organic farming can flourish and spread throughout the country and the world.

Thank you to the Crops Subcommittee for taking on the problem of manure from conventional farms used on organic farms in its Contaminated Input Plan Discussion Document. The report accurately describes the hazards of this off-farm input.<br/><br/>We believe the only solution to this problem is to ban conventional manure from organic, just as sewage sludge has been banned, and for many of the same reasons.<br/><br/>Conventional manure has for many years been shown to contaminate organic food with arsenic and antibiotics.<br/><br/>This is unacceptable and sadly just the tip of the iceberg. Manure from conventional farms contains all of the waste of the farm, including dead animals and any chemicals used in production or cleaning. Not only that, but composted manure processed by methane digesters has often been mixed in with industrial and slaughterhouse wastes.<br/><br/>The minefield of hazards presented by the use of conventional manure in organic are virtually limitless. A ban is the only acceptable solution.<br/><br/>Please pass a recommendation to ban conventional manure from organic.

As a Canadian who frequently eats organic produce grown in the U.S., I feel I have a legitimate stake in your agricultural policies. More and more agricultural chemicals are being implicated in environmental crises (like the pollinator collapse) and human health concerns (like the glyphosate link to cancer.) I implore you to keep strong standards for organic growers, and also, because agrichemicals leach into the environment and their residue ends up in even the most pristine land, to support and encourage more farmers to to transition to organic methods. Chemicals, whether old or new, are not the answer. You must enable farmers to learn and develop different agricultural practices. There have been so many advances in soil science, integrated pest management, understanding potential of naturally developed plant varieties, etc. that using chemicals to farm is no longer the most advanced approach. More important, it is not and has never been sustainable to spread toxins in the fields we grow our childrens&#39; food in. Thank you for your attention in this important matter. sincerely, Maria Kasstan

Inert ingredients in pesticides used in organic production must be individually reviewed without further delay, according to processes recommended by the NOSB. Organic should be chlorine-free. I support research into means of preventing the contamination or organics from outside contamination. Synthetic vitamins and other nutrients should be added to organic food only when required by law, and the law should be changed so it is not required.

Ferric phosphate is used as a molluscicide for of slugs and snails.

It has been proven that pesticide causes harm to animals and causes endocrine system problems in humans.  When children at Texas Children&#39;s Hospital died from cancer they had a high level of pesticide in their fat cells.  When they died from other causes a low amount of pesticide was found. This proves that children that have cancer have high levels of pesticide in their bodies.

In 1990 when the rules were written for the &quot;organic&quot; fertilizers and soil amendments there were no GMO crops being commercially produced in the USA. All that was required of suppliers of manures, cottonseed meal, bonemeal, etc was paperwork to prove its origin. In 2004 when &quot;GMO&quot; production was addressed there were no changes to the rules concerning the verification that the &quot;organic fertilizers and supplements&quot; not be from, processed with or derived from waste of animals being feed &quot;GMO&quot; crops. As an example of how &quot;GMO&quot; crops have found there way into the organic food supply is that 94% of the cotton produced in the US is &quot;GMO&quot;, and 8 states do not allow the use of cottonseed meal as a safe organic fertilizer or organic animal food, how is it that it is still allowed on the national list of acceptable supplements? This is just one example of how contaminated the &quot;organic&quot; fertilizers and supplements are and until a complete toxicology report on all organic fertilizers is required, you are fooling yourselves and the public as to how safe &quot;organic&quot; foods really are. This testing goes for all &quot;organic crop nutritional supplements and manures&quot; and any of these products coming from GMO crops or containing any banned pesticides, growth hormones, antibiotics or any &quot;GE&quot; organisms should not be allowed for use on any organic crops, for your not only contaminating the food being produced but the soil it is being applied to as well as the run-off and ground water. A hydrology study found at : www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/18/333/2014 shows just how damaging the addition of organic matter can be to ground water and currently we are not only polluting it with nitrates but a number of unknown chemicals found in the &quot;organic matter&quot; being applied to the soil. After spending 40+ years in the horticulture industry and currently owning a hydroponic lettuce operation, I&#39;ve learned that we can always make more soil, but we have never learned how to make more water and until mandatory testing for all Organic Fertilizers is implemented, your Eco-friendly method of farming will continue to be nothing more than a huge marketing campaign. The damage being done to the food and water under the current &quot;organic&quot; rules is no better than that of conventional farming of today. Just because it comes from a living organisms does not make it pure and safe, least we forget that coal and oil came from living creatures at one point in time.

I&#39;d like to speak to the use of manure from factory farms on organic farming concerns. <br/>That such a practice doesn&#39;t make moot the certification - as is currently the modus operandi. <br/><br/>If such inputs contain hormones, antibiotics and other chemical elements having passed through the digestive tract of inorganic animals and inherited by the waste - then that source of fertilizer cannot rationally or in good conscience be used for what is supposed to be organically certified produce. <br/><br/>Please increase scrutiny of the standards here to preserve the integrity of organic certification. <br/><br/>Thank you

<br/>I would like to comment on the listing of acidified sodium chlorite (ASC) in combination with lactic acid for use as a topical organic teat dip treatment.  I would urge the NOP/NOSB to have this added to the allowable list so these products will be approved and able to be used on organic dairy farms.  The current active ingredients that are allowed for organic teat dips do not always provide enough protection against the different pathogens that cause mastitis and/or can lead to drying and irritation of teat skin during wet/cold climatic conditions.  We need to consider alternatives as the market has a significant need and we have viable solutions. Let&#39;s help the farmers improve milk quality and enhance cow comfort.

Ferric phosphate is used as a molluscicide for of slugs and snails. Although harmless to molluscs and earthworms alone as it naturally occurs in soil, ferric phosphate is allowed be combined with chelating agents such as EDTA or EDDS, synergists that make it toxic to snails and slugs, but also earthworms and beneficial soil life.

Large corporations (both farming and food manufacturing) are the reason for the need for organic food - food that does not poison us when we consume it.  These entities have a vested interest muddying the &quot;organic&quot; definition, so they can keep their focus on the bottom line and not worry about the process or the end product.  Because the bottom line, and not the end product, is their focus, we have a food supply today that is destroying our health.<br/><br/>Eating organic food is the only healthy option.  Why would you, even for a moment, consider letting them have a say in it?

Synthetic methionine should be phased out of organic poultry feed as the NOSB originally decided. Methionine is an amino acid that acts as a growth promoter (comparable to the synthetic growth promoter rGBH used in dairy cows). The Livestock Subcommittee (LS) proposal would increase use of synthetic methionine above currently allowed levels without any scientific support. Synthetic methionine is not necessary for animal welfare, but is needed to sustain the factory model of egg and broiler production. Neither synthetic amino acids nor synthetic growth promoters are compatible with organic practices. While the LS proposes a resolution to phase out the use of synthetic methionine, it failed to consider including an expiration date for which the proposal was sent back to the subcommittee and without which the phase out cannot be accomplished.

There have been numerous organic farms put out of business due to chemical drift from surrounding farms. Sickly-sweet clouds of pesticide roll through town, and you do not have to look far to find a bee confused and agitated, trying to clean itself as it dies from this pesticide. Here in Saskatchewan we have created a chemical desert. Every year during the growing period, we see crop dusters spraying directly onto red-winged blackbirds that live at the edges of prairie potholes. The tracks from pesticide applicators are all over every crop at all times, and nobody in their right mind would even stroll through the fields because they are so visibly contaminated with chemicals harmful to all life. Put more pressure on the governing bodies to stop the use of harmful chemicals on non-organic farms. The only way to clean things up in a meaningful way is by getting everyone on board with strict regulations against the use of chemicals on all food and farms. That is what people want.

Recent &quot;work&quot; to lessen these standards imperils my health and all Americans. We all deserve the right to high standards and clean food. Please restrict the use of GMO farming near organic farms to protect these farms from migration and its detrimental effect. Please, you have awesome power to provide strict standards and keep moving America into a healthier world reducing the currently increasing threat of cancer. We are what we eat, the toxins in my food up to now have poisoned me. I now chose only organic and I want to trust the standards are met to ensure my continued survival. This is for everyone, we need your vigilance in protecting these standards.

The issues raised by this petition are complex, and the approach to listing glycerin needs to recognize this. Glycerin made by hydrolysis of fats and oil and glycerin made by fermentation should be listed separately. In addition, some of the issues raised by this petition are beyond the purview of the Handling Subcommittee and we request that the Materials/GMO Subcommittee add them to its workplan.

I&#39;m a concerned college student I buy organic because I want the best food for my health and value the strict organic standards set in place to ensure my safety. Organic products are crucial to me because of my chemical sensitivities especially like the added hormones in conventional dairy milk which gave me horrible acne and stomach problem.Switching to organic milk I no longer suffer from those problems anymore. I suffered from hand eczema and using organic hand soap has drastically improved my ezcema on my hands. Organic agriculture helps restore our planet&#39;s soil and ecosystems it also restores the human body&#39;s ecosystem that&#39;s overwhelmed with all the toxins of today&#39;s time. Please uphold the strict usda organic standards to protect consumers and our planet.  <br/>

Thank you to the Crops Subcommittee for taking on the problem of manure from conventional farms used on organic farms in its Contaminated Input Plan Discussion Document. The report accurately describes the hazards of this off-farm input. <br/><br/>We believe the only solution to this problem is to ban conventional manure from organic, just as sewage sludge has been banned, and for many of the same reasons. <br/><br/>Conventional manure has for many years been shown to contaminate organic food with arsenic and antibiotics. <br/><br/>This is unacceptable and sadly just the tip of the iceberg. Manure from conventional farms contains all of the waste of the farm, including dead animals and any chemicals used in production or cleaning. Not only that, but composted manure processed by methane digesters has often been mixed in with industrial and slaughterhouse wastes. <br/><br/>The minefield of hazards presented by the use of conventional manure in organic are virtually limitless. A ban is the only acceptable solution. <br/><br/>Please pass a recommendation to ban conventional manure from organic. - See more at: http://salsa3.salsalabs.com/o/50865/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=16140#sthash.7eysDNCZ.dpuf

1) Synthetic methionine should be phased out of organic poultry feed as the NOSB originally decided. Methionine is an amino acid that acts as a growth promoter. The new proposal increases use instead of increasing space and outdoor access, and alternative feed sources  without any scientific support. Neither synthetic amino acids nor synthetic growth promoters are compatible with organic practices.  <br/>2) Nonorganic agricultural ingredients in organic products should be eliminated based on health and environmental impacts and the ability to produce them organically. Documentation for decisions has been lacking, including environmental and health impacts of pesticides used in their production. Organic agriculture can now supply most, if not all, of these materials.<br/><br/>3) Inert ingredients in pesticides used in organic production must be individually reviewed without further delay, according to processes recommended by the NOSB. So-called inert ingredients in pesticide products are neither chemically nor biologically inert, but designed to enhance the pesticidal activity of pesticide products and can have toxic properties that do not meet the standards of the Organic Foods Production Act (OFPA). <br/><br/>4) Organic should be chlorine-free, to the extent possible. Chlorine is hazardous in its production, transportation, storage, use, and disposal. EPAs Design for the Environment has identified safer viable alternatives for some or all uses, including other materials on the National List. It is time for the NOSB to update its thinking and approach to cleaners and disinfectants.<br/><br/>5) Protecting Organic Farms from Outside Contamination. There should be research into all contaminants and pathways that affect organic farms. We support research into means of preventing the contamination, which must include restrictions on the way other people use many of those materials. Protecting organic farms from outside contamination will require restrictions on what comes onto the farm, but it should also require more responsibility for those who use potentially dangerous materials.<br/> <br/>6) Synthetic vitamins and other nutrients should be added to organic food only when required by law. Consumers expect superior nutrition from organic food that comes from its production in an ecological production management system that promotes and enhances biodiversity, biological cycles, and soil biological activity. Artificial nutrients are inconsistent with that expectation.<br/>

Ammonium hydroxide should be delisted. It is a serious irritant, toxic by all routes of exposure, known to pollute air and water, contributes to the greenhouse effect, and is toxic to fish and other aquatic species. It is not essential because there are other boiler additives on the National List that can be used for the same purpose, and there are practices that can be used in place of boiler additives. As an unnecessary hazardous substance, it is not consistent with organic production practices.

My name is Bill Denevan. I work as a grower representative for an organic brokerage company called Viva Tierra based in  Sedro-Woolley  Washington. I have been with the company meeting with organic growers in Washington,Chile and California for 20 years. From 1976 to 2006 I was a certified organic apple and pear grower with over 100 acres in production.  I make it my job to collect information on organic growing practices and network with producers and packers.<br/>Currently I am working with organic growers in California who were forced into experiments to control fireblight with brand new unproven protocols.  So far there is plenty of blight in many early orchards even with weather favorable for growers NOT to get blight. I fervently hope that the NOSB does not again implement  further bans of essential organic crop protection materials when new substitutes have not been proven. <br/><br/>Materials Organic Growers could not live without:<br/>1. PHEREMONES: In the year 2000 (?) I spoke to the NOSB in Washington D.C. in support. Pheremones are the backbone and cornerstone of all organic tree fruit production. 100% of all organic pear and apple growers now dependant on their use. <br/>2. ELEMENTAL SULFUR:  Basic protectant both for Scab and Mildew.  Sulfur is a very effective material.<br/>3. LIME SULFUR:  Essential for fruit thinning and a contact eradicator of Scab and Mildew. Lime Sulfur is the only material that can be used in organic systems to eliminate  scab spores. I used this material  successfully for over 30 years.<br/>4. HORTICULTURAL OILS : great for fighting Powdery Mildew, S.J. Scale and Rosy apple Aphid.<br/>5. COPPERS: essential material in our new experiments with  Fireblight control.<br/>6. KAOLIN : very effective in controlling Pear Psylla and does a great job protecting fruit from sunburn.<br/><br/>Materials Organic Packers could not thrive without:<br/>1. CHLORINE<br/>2. PARACETIC ACID<br/>3. OZONE<br/><br/>for years organic packers have been nervous about E-Coli, Salmonella and now Listeria. With the current national focus on Food Safety  the organic industry has come a long way in addressing  this issue. Let&#39;s not start banning packing shed materials that are essential to achieving good sanitation. Our industry has worked very hard to build consumer trust. Let&#39;s not lose that trust by banning effective food safety materials.  <br/><br/>Bill <br/>

Hello,<br/>I&#39;m writing to you tonight as a concerned mother of four children. My concern is that organic food remain truly organic and not have anything synthetic added into it from beginning middle and end in production.<br/>The health of my children is my constant concern and as a conscientious mother I work very hard to ensure that my precious children eat only organic foods. I&#39;m even concerned about organic foods when we go out to eat.<br/>Please keep the organic label as truly organic with no added chemicals. Please keep toxic chemicals not deemed safe or truly natural by the FDA from being included in foods labeled organic. It scares me to think my children could ingest toxic chemicals in their little growing bodies. I do not trust GMO foods at all. I urge you to keep organic truly organic. Public health should be paramount over corporate greed. According to the Organic Foods Production Act, a synthetic substance may only be allowed for use in organic production if it meets the following criteria [7 USC 6517(c)(1)(B)]:<br/><br/>    It contains an active synthetic ingredient in the following categories: copper and sulfur compounds; toxins derived from bacteria; pheromones, soaps, horticultural oils, fish emulsions, treated seed, vitamins and minerals; livestock parasiticides and medicines and production aids including netting, tree wraps and seals, insect traps, sticky barriers, row covers, and equipment cleansers.<br/>    It contains synthetic inert ingredients that are not classified by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency as inerts of toxicological concern.<br/><br/>Additionally, it must be fully established that the use of the substance [7 USC 6517(c)(1)(A)]<br/><br/>    would not be harmful to human health or the environment;<br/>    is necessary to the production or handling of the final product because natural substitutes are not available; and<br/>    is consistent with organic farming and handling (see the NOSBs Principles of Organic Production and Handling).<br/>Thank you for your time,<br/>Sincerely,<br/>Danielle White

I am all too well aware of the consequences of consuming gmos, especially canola oil; I was diagnosed with diverticulitis in 1996 while hospitalized because my digestive system had become a pesticide factory. I was being poisoned from within. It took 4 days of some nasty antibiotics in the ICU to get things back on track. I was unable to eat solid food for 2 weeks. All of the heartburn issues which have ballooned over the last 30 or so years are a result of these horrific mutations allowed to invade our daily lives. And it is something which people have looked into, but somehow keeps the truth keeps getting silenced.<br/><br/>If anything, organic standards need to be strengthened. The biotech industry must not be allowed to continue to poison the environment nor our bodies. These companies will stoop to unbelievable lows to hide the facts about their poison producing frankenplants. And the consumers are the guinea pigs for their horrific experiment. One thing is abundantly clear, one cannot wash away what is contained within the plant, part of it&#39;s altered biology. How is that ever &quot;Generally Regarded As Safe&quot;? This is pseudo science and it must be stopped. The claims of feeding the world still haven&#39;t been delivered, because they are baseless claims.<br/><br/>We need to return to a sustainable farming standard. Stop wasting soil for biofuels. Stop the wanton destruction of bees, butterflies and other important species. Promote a diversity of crops and stop relying on weird pseudo-science for non-existent solutions. We need to support local farms, not corporate farming. And we need to put an end to factory farming along with the abuse of hormones and antibiotics. We need to be more like the rest of the sane world.

In these days of industrial agriculture I wish to eat food which is as healthy and without additives as possible, therefore synthetic methionine should be removed from poultry feed and not increased. Instead increases in space, in outdoor areas and in natural food would be a great improvement for poultry. <br/><br/>Why are non-organic agricultural ingredients included in organic products when organic can produce most of them itself?<br/><br/>Pesticides with &quot;inert&quot; ingredients used in organic products should be individually tested for toxic properties that are sub-standard.<br/><br/>Chlorine, which can be dangerous in use, should not be in organic products.<br/><br/>Protecting organic farms from outside contamination requires research, restrictions and responsibility from everyone using potentially dangerous materials.<br/><br/>I expect the highest nutrition from organic foods that do not contain artificial nutrients except when required by law.

Nonorganic agricultural materials allowed in organic processing and handling are listed as 205.606. Nonorganic Agricultural Ingredients in organic products should be eliminated based on health and environmental impacts and the ability to produce them organically. Many of these materials have never been subject to a technical review. In many cases, the NOSB gave no documentation for decisions, with reviews uniformly ignoring environmental and health impacts of their chemical-intensive agricultural production, including the use of pesticides. Additionally, organic agriculture can now supply most, if not all, of these materials.

Synthetic methionine should be phased out of organic poultry feed as the NOSB originally decided. Methionine is an amino acid that acts as a growth promoter (comparable to the synthetic growth promoter rGBH used in dairy cows). The new proposal increases use instead of increasing space and outdoor access, and alternative feed sources without any scientific support. Neither synthetic amino acids nor synthetic growth promoters are compatible with organic practices. The phase out requires an expiration date. Learn more here. Nonorganic agricultural ingredients in organic products should be eliminated based on health and environmental impacts and the ability to produce them organically. Documentation for decisions has been lacking, including environmental and health impacts of pesticides used in their production. Organic agriculture can now supply most, if not all, of these materials.<br/>Inert ingredients in pesticides used in organic production must be individually reviewed without further delay, according to processes recommended by the NOSB. So-called inert ingredients in pesticide products are neither chemically nor biologically inert, but designed to enhance the pesticidal activity of pesticide products and can have toxic properties that do not meet the standards of the Organic Foods Production Act (OFPA).<br/>Organic should be chlorine-free, to the extent possible. Chlorine is hazardous in its production, transportation, storage, use, and disposal. EPAs Design for the Environment has identified safer viable alternatives for some or all uses, including other materials on the<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>National List. It is time for the NOSB to update its thinking and approach to cleaners and disinfectants. <br/>Other key issues we need your help on include:<br/><br/>    Protecting Organic Farms from Outside Contamination. I support research into all contaminants and pathways that affect organic farms. We support research into means of preventing the contamination, which must include restrictions on the way other people use many of those materials. Protecting organic farms from outside contamination will require restrictions on what comes onto the farm, but it should also require more responsibility for those who use potentially dangerous materials. <br/>    Synthetic vitamins and other nutrients should be added to organic food only when required by law. Consumers expect superior nutrition from organic food that comes from its production in an ecological production management system that promotes and enhances biodiversity, biological cycles, and soil biological activity. Artificial nutrients are inconsistent with that expectation. Thank you!<br/><br/>

I try to purchase organic products not so much for my health, but rather for the health of the planet.  I believe we must all do our very best to protect our environment and all its life forms.  Therefore I think organic standards should be very specific about what is appropriate in &quot;organic&quot; items.  Antibiotics should be prohibited in order to restrict their use for medical necessities.  Artificial or synthetic substances, should be allowed only if they are proven not harmful to health of consumers, animals and the environment and if natural substances are not available.<br/><br/>I would also encourage you to put in place provisions to protect organic farmers from contamination by their non organic neighbors. Pesticide drift and cross pollination by genetically engineered crops must be the responsibility of the non organic growers, not the organic farmers.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering my thought on this matter.

Nonorganic agricultural materials allowed in organic processing and handling are listed as 205.606. Nonorganic Agricultural Ingredients in organic products should be eliminated based on health and environmental impacts and the ability to produce them organically. Many of these materials have never been subject to a technical review. In many cases, the NOSB gave no documentation for decisions, with reviews uniformly ignoring environmental and health impacts of their chemical-intensive agricultural production, including the use of pesticides. Additionally, organic agriculture can now supply most, if not all, of these materials.

Am I to understand that those who work in our government are willing to eat the foods that the U.S. people are NOT willing to eat? What will they be eating when we are all eating clean , healthy ORGANIC food? Are they willing to serve their kids and grandkids GMO corn this summer? How about chinese food with GMO soy on it? You can eat  all the GMO&#39;S you want you want but the American citizens want ALL GMO&#39;s stopped NOW. No if&#39;s and&#39;s or buts about it!!! If you want to serve another term you had better take heed. If you do decided to let GMO&#39;s be grown in our country, don&#39;t expect any sympathy from the U.S. citizens when your children or grandchildren are born deformed or with cancer. It will be sad, YES VERY SAD, and unfortunate , but the decision is in your hands right now and you have to make good choices.  PLEASE, Keep your family and all of ours safe from tyrants like Monsanto, Bayer, Syngenta and people who sit in our government but are either receiving benefits from these companies or sit on the boards of these companies who wish to do us all harm for the sake of wealth.

We are being poisoned every day and I&#39;m sick of it. Big corporations with big money lobbies own our government. Both parties, but mostly republicans by a large margin are guilty. The media, which is supposed to provide us with critical information so we, as and informed populace, can know what to be outraged about is letting us down. The media is the big problem here because if they were doing their job none of this would be possible. But that&#39;s not likely to happen when monsanto pays for the news.<br/>We are fed stories about celebrity scandals and cute kittens playing with yarn when we should be watching stories about how giant corporations are poisoning us for profit. Never mind that our police forces across the country are arming themselves as though isis were coming to town and waging war with impunity against the American people.<br/>Sure, we can be hopeful about progress in gay marriage and minimal advances in healthcare. But healthcare is still leaving millions uncovered and those who are covered have a short blanket on a cold night. And don&#39;t get me started on school loans.<br/>In Germany, all healthcare and all education, all of it, is free. This is Germany I&#39;m talking about. Remember those guys. We won a war against them and they are doing much better across the board. They don&#39;t allow GMOs in their country. They know they are unsafe. All of Europe knows that. Who are these people who chant, &quot;USA, USA, USA&quot; every time someone waves a flag?<br/>What country are they living in? People tell me, if you don&#39;t like it, move.  But if you stay don&#39;t badmouth America. That&#39;s being unpatriotic. Patriotism, the last bastion of the scoundrel. I don&#39;t know which politician if any will read this message. But if I want them to pay attention to it I need to include a check for an obscene amount of money. That&#39;s the only noise those guys can hear.<br/>

Please keep synthetic additives and GMOs out of organic food!  As the mother of a young child with food allergies and chemical sensitives, I cannot stress enough how important it is to have substantial limitations on what can be included as &quot;organic&quot; food and to make sure that the &quot;organic&quot; standards ensure that we have an option for food that is free from synthetic additives and GMO&#39;s.  <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Michelle Jaffe

 Synthetic methionine should be phased out of organic poultry feed as the NOSB originally decided. Methionine is an amino acid that acts as a growth promoter (comparable to the synthetic growth promoter rGBH used in dairy cows). The new proposal increases use instead of increasing space and outdoor access, and alternative feed sources without any scientific support. Neither synthetic amino acids nor synthetic growth promoters are compatible with organic practices. The phase out requires an expiration date.  <br/><br/> Nonorganic agricultural ingredients in organic products should be eliminated based on health and environmental impacts and the ability to produce them organically. Documentation for decisions has been lacking, including environmental and health impacts of pesticides used in their production. Organic agriculture can now supply most, if not all, of these materials. <br/><br/> Inert ingredients in pesticides used in organic production must be individually reviewed without further delay, according to processes recommended by the NOSB. So-called inert ingredients in pesticide products are neither chemically nor biologically inert, but designed to enhance the pesticidal activity of pesticide products and can have toxic properties that do not meet the standards of the Organic Foods Production Act (OFPA). <br/><br/> Organic should be chlorine-free, to the extent possible. Chlorine is hazardous in its production, transportation, storage, use, and disposal. EPAs Design for the Environment has identified safer viable alternatives for some or all uses, including other materials on the National List. It is time for the NOSB to update its thinking and approach to cleaners and disinfectants. <br/>

I count on your certification to protect our health by informing me about products I am consuming so that I can make informed choices. I understand that animal wastes from factory farms are allowed in organic compost. This waste is full of heavy metals, antibiotics, pesticides, cleaning chemicals and phamaceuticals, much of which is not destroyed in the composting process. This is wrong and should be reflected in your regulations, either by requiring further testing or just by disallowing wastes from factory farms. Otherwise your certification is meaningless.<br/><br/>Please retain your integrity. It is sorely needed in these times of rampant pollution and corruption!<br/><br/>thank you.

We have devolved into a country wherein corporate farmers are poisoning the food chain, and food processors are adding more poison in their products.  We absolutely need organic farming and standards so that those of us who wish to avoid the many health problems associated with our poisoned food supply will have a reliable source of food.  Otherwise, we will all be forced to grow our own, and that ultimately, will screw up the corporate farmers and food manufacturers more than any hewing to reasonable regulations will.<br/><br/>Corporations in this country need to get over the greedy chase for the quick buck, and start looking at the long-term again.

Whole algal flour is not essential or compatible with organic production and handling. We believe that there is too much confidential business information to determine that it meets criteria under the Organic Foods Production Act (OFPA). It would replace natural foods including cream, milk, eggs and egg yolks, and butter or shortening. All of these natural foods contribute nutrients to the diet, and it is not clear what whole algal flour contributes to the diet.

RE: Comment on Proposed Rule on Origin of Livestock (Docket Number AMS-NOP-11-0009; NOP-11-04PR)<br/><br/>To Whom It May Concern:<br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to provide public input on the National Organic Program&#39;s Proposed Rule on the Origin of Livestock. I respectfully urge you to close the loophole that has allowed the continued practice of bringing in conventional cattle onto organic farms. This loophole has been abused.<br/><br/>However, the proposed new rule appears to create a new loophole that I want to see closed to prevent the ongoing abuse of the intent and spirit of organic law.  There is already evidence that &#39;organic&#39; farms are not following the organic law and it is important to enforce the law.<br/><br/>Specifically, I support the following two changes:<br/><br/>The rule must require that any organic dairy farm selling organic animals be a functioning &quot;commercial dairy&quot; that is inspected and permitted by the state in which it operates. Furthermore, this dairy farm must have a relationship with a licensed milk handler shipping to a licensed dairy plant. In addition, this operation should be fully established, shipping milk, for no less than 180 days and that any animal sold has been producing milk itself. This means that no young transitioned heifers, who have never been milked, could qualify for sale as &quot;organic&quot;.<br/><br/>Should the National Organic Program seek an alternative solution to the potential loophole noted above, they could choose to ban, outright, the sale to an organic operation of any cattle that had been transitioned from conventional production to organic production.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering my comments on this important matter.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Violet R.

RE: Comment on Proposed Rule on Origin of Livestock (Docket Number AMS-NOP-11-0009; NOP-11-04PR)<br/><br/>To Whom It May Concern:<br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to provide public input on the National Organic Program&#39;s Proposed Rule on the Origin of Livestock. I fully support the effort to close the loophole that has allowed the continued practice of bringing in conventional cattle onto organic farms. This loophole has been abused and allowed factory farm livestock operations to manage their herds using practices that aren&#39;t sustainable and do not promote the health of their livestock.<br/><br/>However, the proposed new rule appears to create a new loophole that I want to see closed to prevent the ongoing abuse of the intent and spirit of organic law.<br/><br/>Specifically, I support the following two changes:<br/><br/>    The rule must require that any organic dairy farm selling organic animals be a functioning &quot;commercial dairy&quot; that is inspected and permitted by the state in which it operates. Furthermore, this dairy farm must have a relationship with a licensed milk handler shipping to a licensed dairy plant. In addition, this operation should be fully established, shipping milk, for no less than 180 days and that any animal sold has been producing milk itself. This means that no young transitioned heifers, who have never been milked, could qualify for sale as &quot;organic&quot;.<br/><br/>    Should the National Organic Program seek an alternative solution to the potential loophole noted above, they could choose to ban, outright, the sale to an organic operation of any cattle that had been transitioned from conventional production to organic production.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering my comments on this important matter.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Teresa McCabe

To Whom It May Concern:<br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to provide public input on the National Organic Programs Proposed Rule on the Origin of Livestock. I fully support the effort to close the loopholes that have allowed the continued practice of bringing conventional livestock on to organic farms. This loophole has been abused and has allowed factory farm livestock operations to manage their herds using practices that are not sustainable and do not promote the health of their livestock.<br/><br/>However, the proposed new rule appears to create a new loophole that I want to see closed to prevent the ongoing abuse of the intent and spirit of organic law.<br/><br/>Specifically, I support the following changes:<br/><br/>The rule must require that any organic dairy farm selling organic animals be a functioning commercial dairy that is inspected and permitted by the state in which it operates. Furthermore, this dairy farm must have a relationship with a licensed milk handler shipping to a licensed dairy plant. In addition, this operation should be fully established, shipping milk for no less than 180 days and any animal sold should be producing milk itself. This means that no young transitioned heifers, who have never been milked, could qualify for sale as organic.<br/><br/>Should the National Organic Program seek a definitive solution to the potential loophole noted above, they could choose to ban, outright, the sale to an organic operation of any cattle that had been transitioned from conventional production to organic production.<br/>The final rule should close the loophole for breeding stock by creating additional safeguards that would prevent rotating animals in and out of organic production and only allow periodic and limited editions for genetic diversity (prohibiting the practice of converting first litter sows to organic production on a continual basis).<br/>Thank you for considering my comments on this important matter.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Kristine Pernek

Trite as it sounds, to me organic is organic, and it seems logical that conventionally raised animals have no place in an organic operation;furthermore, I think the &quot;transitioning&quot; of conventionally raised animals is an opportunity for abuse and further deterioration of the public&#39;s trust.

Stop the &quot;transitioning&quot; of calves into organic milk production and enforce organic gestation. After all, an organic product,(milk), cannot be achieved through non organic farming. Start considering the consumer who is being defrauded by these practices rather than the producer who is &quot;cheating&quot; and not complying with the spirit of the organic process. Milk is either organic or not.<br/>And as a consumer who has been vigilant in sourcing &quot;organic&quot; milk and paid premium prices for that product, I am disgusted by the deceit of the :&quot;organic milk producers&quot; and the government agencies that allowed this practice to happen and continue.Doesn&#39;t anyone have any integrity ?

This loophole has been abused and allowed factory farm livestock operations to manage their herds using practices that aren&#39;t sustainable and do not promote the health of their livestock.<br/><br/> However, the proposed new rule appears to create a new loophole that I want to see closed to prevent the ongoing abuse of the intent and spirit of organic law.<br/><br/> Specifically, I support the following two changes:<br/>The rule must require that any organic dairy farm selling organic animals be a functioning &quot;commercial dairy&quot; that is inspected and permitted by the state in which it operates. Furthermore, this dairy farm must have a relationship with a licensed milk handler shipping to a licensed dairy plant. In addition, this operation should be fully established, shipping milk, for no less than 180 days and that any animal sold has been producing milk itself. This means that no young transitioned heifers, who have never been milked, could qualify for sale as &quot;organic&quot;.<br/><br/>Should the National Organic Program seek an alternative solution to the potential loophole noted above, they could choose to ban, outright, the sale to an organic operation of any cattle that had been transitioned from conventional production to organic production.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering my comments on this important matter.<br/><br/> Sincerely,<br/>

Dear Gov,<br/><br/>It&#39;s quite clear that we are living in an oligarchy.  The American People may have a fair amount of idiots, but certainly it isn&#39;t the majority.<br/><br/>It is becoming more and more apparent that Big Business, namely Monsanto, Dow, DuPont, Syngenta, et al, have WAY too much influence in how the country is being &quot;run.&quot;  <br/><br/>When the stench of big money is stronger than the health and safety of the Citizenry, it is only a matter of time before the poo hits the fan.  How in the name of all that is decent can people elected to serve the Citizens of this country have such a lack of conscience that they will deliberately POISON those they are SWORN to protect?<br/><br/>Please understand that the organic way of farming and raising animals for consumption is the way things SHOULD BE, and trying to undermine this for the sake of profit is INTOLERABLE.<br/><br/>Do the right thing, and do it now.  NO mismanaged cows in organic farms, thank you very much.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Jaan Carter

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:<br/><br/>Thank you for this opportunity for input on the National Organic Program&#39;s Proposed Rule on the Origin of Livestock.  I definitely support the effort to close loopholes that have allowed the continued practice of conventional livestock being brought onto organic farms.  However, the proposed new rule appears to open a new loophole that I feel should be closed.  I support the Cornucopia Institute&#39;s suggested changes. Specifically, the rule must require that any organic dairy farm selling organic animals be a functioning &quot;commercial dairy&quot; that is inspected and permitted by the state in which it operates.  It must have a relationship with a licensed milk handler shipping to a licensed dairy plant.  It should be fully established, and any animal sold should be producing milk itself.  No young transitioned heifers who have never been milked could qualify for sale as &quot;organic.&quot;<br/><br/>Should the National Organic Program look for a solution to the potential loophole above, they could choose to ban outright the sale to an organic operation of any cattle that had been transitioned from a conventional production to organic production.<br/><br/>And last, but not least. the final rule should close the loophole for breeding stock by the creation of additional safeguards that would prevent rotating animals in and out of organic production.  It should only allow periodic and limited editions for genetic diversity (prohibiting the practice of converting first litter sows to organic production on a continual basis).<br/><br/>Thank you, I appreciate your taking the time to read my comments on this very important matter.<br/>

Holy Cow!<br/><br/>The problem with the proposed rule is that USDA bureaucrats define a dairy farm as any farm milking at least one cow! The farm does not even have to be a commercially licensed dairy. Theoretically, a farm could have a single cow that they milk and this would then allow them to also raise thousands of conventionally fed dairy heifers and transition them to organic, before ultimately selling the transitioned animals to the factory dairies already exploiting consumer trust. This would allow the same flagrant abuses to keep occurring.<br/><br/>Cornucopia makes the following suggested changes to the rule:<br/>Require the farm to be a &quot;commercial dairy,&quot; inspected and permitted by the state, and have a relationship with a licensed milk handler shipping to a licensed dairy plant. Furthermore, the operation should be fully established, shipping milk, for no less than 180 days and that any animal sold has been producing milk themselves (no young transitioned heifers, who have never been milked, could qualify to be sold as &quot;organic&quot;).<br/><br/>An even more powerful and simpler solution would be to ban, outright, the sale to an organic operation of any cattle that had been transitioned from conventional production to organic production<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>I strongly agree with the above, Do your job- Protect Our lands, waters, wildlife, future &amp; health!

You cannot allow conventional cows on organic farms. The whole point of organic is that the cows are pastured and raised sustainably. Factory farm conventional cows fed GMO feed is not organic. This will create a problem within the food supply and render the organic label worthless! Please honor organic and make the distinction that conventional diary cows do not belong on organic farms!

I am in agreement with  The Cornucopia Institutes suggested changes to the proposed origin of livestock rule. I am a simple volunteer farmer and most all my reading is devoted to organic <br/>methods of farming for fruits, vegetables and livestock.<br/><br/>Conventional cows do not belong on organic farms. IN addition as stated by Cornucopia  I fully support &quot;the effort to close the loophole that has allowed the continued practice of bringing in conventional cattle onto organic farms. This loophole has been abused and allowed factory farm livestock operations to manage their herds using practices that aren&#39;t sustainable and do not promote the health of their livestock.&quot;<br/><br/>Thank you for this opportunity to voice my and my families values. In years to come I believe it will be evident that sustainable, organic practices for all farms and animals  is the only way humans can sustain and maintain their health. I firmly believe as it has changed the health of myself and family regarding meat and dairy that animals were not put here to be abused but to live a wholesome life in order to provide us with one.

<br/>    Require the farm to be a &quot;commercial dairy,&quot; inspected and permitted by the state, and have a relationship with a licensed milk handler shipping to a licensed dairy plant. Furthermore, the operation should be fully established, shipping milk, for no less than 180 days and that any animal sold has been producing milk themselves (no young transitioned heifers, who have never been milked, could qualify to be sold as &quot;organic&quot;).<br/><br/>    An even more powerful and simpler solution would be to ban, outright, the sale to an organic operation of any cattle that had been transitioned from conventional production to organic production.<br/>

However, the draft proposal could allow operations producing both conventional and organic livestock to shuffle animals back and forth between organic and conventional management. This is completely unacceptable.<br/><br/>    Close the loophole for breeding stock by creating additional safeguards that could prevent rotating animals in and out of organic production and only allow periodic and limited additions for genetic diversity (prohibiting the practice of converting first litter sows to organic production on a continual basis). <br/><br/>I agree with The Cornucopia Institutes suggested changes to the proposed origin of livestock rule.

I also agree with The Cornucopia Institutes suggested changes to the proposed &quot;origin of livestock&quot; rule being one or preferably the later of these two:<br/><br/>  -- The rule must require that any organic dairy farm selling organic animals be a functioning &quot;commercial dairy&quot; that is inspected and permitted by the state in which it operates. Furthermore, this dairy farm must have a relationship with a licensed milk handler shipping to a licensed dairy plant. In addition, this operation should be fully established, shipping milk, for no less than 180 days and that any animal sold has been producing milk themselves.

To Whom It May Concern:<br/><br/>I would like to provide input on the National Organic Programs Proposed Rule on the Origin of Livestock. I fully support the effort to close loopholes that have allowed the continued practice of bringing conventional livestock on to organic farms. This loophole has been abused and has allowed factory farm livestock operations to skirt the spirit of the law that is followed by traditional organic family farms, making it much more difficult for them to remain competitive.<br/><br/>However, the proposed new rule appears apparently creates a new loophole that needs to be closed to prevent the ongoing abuse of the intent and spirit of organic law.<br/><br/>Specifically, I support the following changes:<br/><br/>The rule must require that any organic dairy farm selling organic animals be a functioning commercial dairy that is inspected and permitted by the state in which it operates. Furthermore, this dairy farm must have a relationship with a licensed milk handler shipping to a licensed dairy plant. In addition, this operation should be fully established, shipping milk for no less than 180 days and any animal sold should be producing milk itself. This means that no young transitioned heifers, who have never been milked, could qualify for sale as organic.<br/><br/>Should the National Organic Program seek a definitive solution to the potential loophole noted above, they could choose to ban, outright, the sale to an organic operation of any cattle that had been transitioned from conventional production to organic production.<br/>The final rule should close the loophole for breeding stock by creating additional safeguards that would prevent rotating animals in and out of organic production and only allow periodic and limited editions for genetic diversity (prohibiting the practice of converting first litter sows to organic production on a continual basis).<br/><br/>Thank you for considering my comments on this important matter.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Jane Scharankov

Require the farm to be a commercial dairy, inspected and permitted by the state, and have a relationship with a licensed milk handler shipping to a licensed dairy plant. Furthermore, the operation should be fully established, shipping milk, for no less than 180 days and that any animal sold has been producing milk themselves (no young transitioned heifers, who have never been milked, could qualify to be sold as organic).<br/>An even more powerful and simpler solution would be to ban, outright, the sale to an organic operation of any cattle that had been transitioned from conventional production to organic production.

I fully support the effort to close the loopholes that have allowed the continued practice of bringing conventional livestock on to organic farms. This loophole has been abused and has allowed factory farm livestock operations to manage their herds using practices that are not sustainable and do not promote the health of their livestock. When I buy products labeled as organic, it is because I believe food should come from animals that have been raised in a healthy and humane manner, which is not the manner in which factory farms are run. I want healthy meat and dairy products for my family and self, that come from animals that were happy and healthy until their final day. Poor heath and disease cause physical ailments in animals that compromise the quality of the food item they become, or produce, and impact the heath of the consumer, in this instance, my family and I. Please close the loophole so that my family knows it is getting better quality food when that food is labeled organic.<br/><br/>However, the proposed new rule appears to create a new loophole that I want to see closed to prevent the ongoing abuse of the intent and spirit of organic law.<br/><br/>Specifically, I support the following changes:<br/><br/>The rule must require that any organic dairy farm selling organic animals be a functioning commercial dairy that is inspected and permitted by the state in which it operates.

Furthermore, this dairy farm must have a relationship with a licensed milk handler shipping to a licensed dairy plant. In addition, this operation should be fully established, shipping milk for no less than 180 days and any animal sold should be producing milk itself. This means that no young transitioned heifers, who have never been milked, could qualify for sale as organic.<br/><br/>Should the National Organic Program seek a definitive solution to the potential loophole noted above, they could choose to ban, outright, the sale to an organic operation of any cattle that had been transitioned from conventional production to organic production.<br/>The final rule should close the loophole for breeding stock by creating additional safeguards that would prevent rotating animals in and out of organic production and only allow periodic and limited editions for genetic diversity (prohibiting the practice of converting first litter sows to organic production on a continual basis).<br/><br/>Personally,  I long for the day when animal farming is in our remote history.  It is abusive and wasteful of resources and immeasurably destructive of our entire ecosystem.  The elimination of the greenhouse gases alone could repair our climate.  Until that day comes, let&#39;s do the best we can.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering my comments on this important matter.<br/><br/>

<br/>Thank you for the opportunity to provide public input on the National Organic Programs Proposed Rule on the Origin of Livestock. I fully support the effort to close the loopholes that have allowed the continued practice of bringing conventional livestock on to organic farms. This loophole has been abused and has allowed factory farm livestock operations to manage their herds using practices that are not sustainable and do not promote the health of their livestock.<br/><br/>However, the proposed new rule appears to create a new loophole that I want to see closed to prevent the ongoing abuse of the intent and spirit of organic law.<br/><br/>Specifically, I support the following changes:<br/><br/>The rule must require that any organic dairy farm selling organic animals be a functioning commercial dairy that is inspected and permitted by the state in which it operates. Furthermore, this dairy farm must have a relationship with a licensed milk handler shipping to a licensed dairy plant. In addition, this operation should be fully established, shipping milk for no less than 180 days and any animal sold should be producing milk itself. This means that no young transitioned heifers, who have never been milked, could qualify for sale as organic.<br/><br/>Should the National Organic Program seek a definitive solution to the potential loophole noted above, they could choose to ban, outright, the sale to an organic operation of any cattle that had been transitioned from conventional production to organic production.<br/>The final rule should close the loophole for breeding stock by creating additional safeguards that would prevent rotating animals in and out of organic production and only allow periodic and limited editions for genetic diversity (prohibiting the practice of converting first litter sows to organic production on a continual basis).<br/>Thank you for considering my comments on this important matter.

Thank you for the opportunity to provide public input on the National Organic Program&#39;s Proposed Rule on the Origin of Livestock. I have been buying mostly organic products for over 20 years and believe that organic products are important for my health.  I have been a vegetarian for over 30 years and believe that organic livestock practices are more humane to the livestock and produce healthier products.  Therefore, I fully support the effort to close the loophole that has allowed the continued practice of bringing in conventional cattle onto organic farms. <br/><br/>However, the proposed new rule appears to create a new loophole that I want to see closed to prevent the ongoing abuse of the intent and spirit of organic law.<br/><br/>Specifically, I support the following two changes:<br/><br/>    * The rule must require that any organic dairy farm selling organic animals be a functioning &quot;commercial dairy&quot; that is inspected and permitted by the state in which it operates. Furthermore, this dairy farm must have a relationship with a licensed milk handler shipping to a licensed dairy plant. In addition, this operation should be fully established, shipping milk, for no less than 180 days and that any animal sold has been producing milk itself.

RE: Comment on Proposed Rule on Origin of Livestock (Docket Number AMS-NOP-11-0009; NOP-11-04PR)<br/><br/> To Whom It May Concern:<br/><br/>Below is a technical and well reasoned comment on the proposed rule regarding the origin of livestock used in organic dairy and meat production which I encourage you to read. I am not a farmer, but I am a consumer of organic products. From reading about the proposed rules and the practices of factory farm operations, I smell a rat. It is perfectly clear that the factory farms are skirting the intentions of the national organics program by continuously bringing in animals bred and maintained by conventional farming practices. I will not purchase any products produced in this way. I will support family farms who follow the spirit and letter of the law and ask that you institute new rules that support these farmers who produce authentic organic food.<br/><br/>I wholeheartedly agree with The Cornucopia Institutes suggested changes to the proposed origin of livestock rule.<br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to provide public input on the National Organic Programs Proposed Rule on the Origin of Livestock. I fully support the effort to close the loopholes that have allowed the continued practice of bringing conventional livestock on to organic farms. This loophole has been abused and has allowed factory farm livestock operations to manage their herds using practices that are not sustainable and do not promote the health of their livestock.<br/><br/> However, the proposed new rule appears to create a new loophole that I want to see closed to prevent the ongoing abuse of the intent and spirit of organic law.<br/><br/> Specifically, I support the following changes:<br/><br/>The rule must require that any organic dairy farm selling organic animals be a functioning commercial dairy that is inspected and permitted by the state in which it operates.

The farm needs to be defined as a commercial dairy, inspected and permitted by the state, and have a relationship with a licensed milk handler shipping to a licensed dairy plant. The farm should be fully established, shipping milk, for no less than 180 days. Any animal sold needs to have been producing milk themselves, so no young transitioned heifers, who have never been milked, could qualify to be sold as organic.<br/>An even more powerful and simpler solution would be to ban, outright, the sale to an organic operation of any cattle that had been transitioned from conventional production to organic production.

This loophole has been abused and allowed factory farm livestock operations to manage their herds using practices that aren&#39;t sustainable and do not promote the health of their livestock.<br/><br/>However, the proposed new rule appears to create a new loophole that I want to see closed to prevent the ongoing abuse of the intent and spirit of organic law.<br/><br/>Specifically, I support the following two changes:<br/><br/>    The rule must require that any organic dairy farm selling organic animals be a functioning &quot;commercial dairy&quot; that is inspected and permitted by the state in which it operates. Furthermore, this dairy farm must have a relationship with a licensed milk handler shipping to a licensed dairy plant. In addition, this operation should be fully established, shipping milk, for no less than 180 days and that any animal sold has been producing milk itself. This means that no young transitioned heifers, who have never been milked, could qualify for sale as &quot;organic&quot;.<br/><br/>    Should the National Organic Program seek an alternative solution to the potential loophole noted above, they could choose to ban, outright, the sale to an organic operation of any cattle that had been transitioned from conventional production to organic production.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering my comments on this important matter.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Margaret Knight

I believe that maintaining a high level of quality for the organic label is of utmost importance in enabling me to keep myself and my family healthy.<br/><br/>Factory farms, milking thousands of cows each, have been regularly bringing in conventional cattle to both grow their operations and replace animals burned out by their high production management approach. Instead of raising the new animals on organic milk and feed, these cattle are raised on medicated milk replacer that includes antibiotics, and fed GMO grains and hay treated with toxic pesticides. This is not right or ethical. The intent of the proposed new rule is to prevent this practice. I agree with the changes suggested by the Cornucopia Institute. Thank you.<br/><br/>Cornucopia makes the following suggested changes to the rule:<br/><br/>    Require the farm to be a &quot;commercial dairy,&quot; inspected and permitted by the state, and have a relationship with a licensed milk handler shipping to a licensed dairy plant. Furthermore, the operation should be fully established, shipping milk, for no less than 180 days and that any animal sold has been producing milk themselves (no young transitioned heifers, who have never been milked, could qualify to be sold as &quot;organic&quot;).<br/><br/>    An even more powerful and simpler solution would be to ban, outright, the sale to an organic operation of any cattle that had been transitioned from conventional production to organic production.<br/>

I support the USDAs AMS proposal to amend the origin of livestock requirements for dairy animals under the USDA organic regulations. <br/><br/>With demand for organic products growing rapidly, the market needs to be able to keep up without compromising quality. According to the USDA, the United States is already spending over a billion dollars a year to import organic products. If US wants to compete with foreign markets, we need to encourage farmers to go organic and to convince consumers that US organic products are safe and healthy. <br/><br/>The proposed rules are a step in the right direction. The much needed clarification of the regulation and definitions will allow farmers transition over to organic farming with more confidence. Your report claims that certification and compliance were cited as the most difficult aspect of organic milk production for farms in the Upper Midwest and Northeast. In another section, you stated that audit reports on organic milk operations showed that certifying agents were interpreting the origin of livestock requirements differently. I was surprised to read that half of the certifying agents had one interpretation of the language while the other half had another interpretation. This kind of ambiguity is unacceptable and does very little to encourage organic farming. With agents who are at odds over the meaning of key rules, its not surprising that farmers cite certification and compliance as primary concerns. Not only does the standard need to be precise, but it must also be consistent. The proposed rule would tighten the language and leave less room for such a broad interpretation.<br/><br/>Clarification will also lead to consumer confidence because it allows for more transparency. As mentioned in the previous comments, consumers expect organic milk to be produced without the use of excluded methods and substances prohibited under the regulations. They also mentioned that organic dairy products were keystone products for consumer confidence and a major stepping-stone to additional purchases in other organic categories. This is easy to believe when examining the statistics provided in your report that show organic dairy as the second largest sector in organic retail sales. It makes sense that organic dairy would be heavily scrutinized. There is a lot of misinformation on what is and isnt organic not to mention individual interpretations of the term. Strong and clear regulation detailing the process of how a farm transitions to organic will make it easier for consumers to buy with confidence.  <br/><br/>I applaud the AMS for choosing not to allow a staggering transition. I agree that it would make the process unnecessarily complicated and add additional burden on the farmers and agencies. It would also greatly increase the chances of contamination. <br/><br/>Clarification on how breeder stock should be managed on organic livestock farms is vital and I support the AMSs proposals and reiterations.

I support the proposed rule National Organic Program (NOP) - Origin of Livestock, docket number AMS-NOP-11-0009.  The 1st Quarter 2015 CHOICES article Consumer Demand for Organic Milk Continues to Expand  Can the U.S. Dairy Sector Catch Up? describes signs of organic milk shortages by the end of the year.  Alarmingly, organic dairy farming in California, which produces 16.8% of the organic milk for the U.S., is declining.  The drought, high organic feed grain prices, and strong competition for their land from other high-value commodities might explain the decline in organic dairy pastures in California.  However, according to a 2015 Organic Trade Association survey, the organic dairy sector had an almost 11% increase in sales in 2014, with sales reaching $5.46 billion.  With the potential reduced supply of organic milk coupled with increased consumer demands, consumers should feel confident that there is consistency in the transition of dairy animals into organic production.<br/><br/>The cost of raising an organic dairy animal is more expensive than raising a conventional animal.  While it may be cheaper to purchase conventional replacements and transition them, if this practice is allowed on a continual basis, it could provide for reduced incentive to produce organic dairy replacement animal.  If producers are able to transition animals on a continual basis, consumer confidence may go down due to lack of consistency.  It seems reasonable to allow producers to get new organic animals from other dairies with transitioned animals, or animals that were treated organically from the last third of gestation. <br/><br/>I also support linking the transition to a given producer as opposed to linking a transition to a specific location.  If the transition was linked to a particular farm, then this could create problems for record keeping.  It would be easier and more efficient to link the transition to a producer (individual or corporation).  A certifying agent would be more able to keep track of a transition that occurred under a person as opposed herds on a specified piece of land.  Also, linking a transition to a physical location could drive down the prices for dairy farms when a producer is selling the land.  If a producer has already transitioned animals on that particular site, this could be a disincentive for another producer, who might want to eventually transition animals, to purchase the land.<br/><br/>As current regulations address some of the responsibilities of the certifying agents (e.g. whether animals are organically managed from the last third of gestation and record-keeping), the added responsibilities for certifying agents under this rule should be minimal.  Good record keeping, communication, and training staff to examine production history should not be too much of a burden to implement this rule.  I also agree that as of the effective date, producers who are certified would be allowed to complete an ongoing transition.  However, I wo

I BELIEVE THIS PROPOSAL MAKES A FRAUD OUT OF TH EORGANIC PROGRAM. A FRAUD ON THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY. ORGANIC FROM THE BEGINNING IS REQUIRED, NOT LAST 1/2 OF GESTATION. FROM BEFORE GESTATION IS THE WAY ORGANIC SHOULD BE. YOU ARE EITHER ORGANIC OR YOU ARE NOT. YOU EITHER DECIDE TO GO ALL THE WAY OR DONT DO IT. THIS APPEARS TO BE ANOTHER SNEAK MOVE BY A FAT CAT BUREAUCRACY WHICH HAS LOST ALL TRUST FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DUE TO ACTIVITIES LIKE THE MEAT ANIMAL RESEARCH FARM, DROWNING ANIMALS SO THEIR HOOVES COME OFF FROM OVER DRUGGING, CAFOS, FACTORY FARMS, ETC. THE HORROR OF WHAT IS DONE TO PLANTS AND ANIMALS BY THIS AGENCY IS MASSIVE. MOST AMERICANS HAVE NO FAITH IN THIS DEPT ANYMORE. THEY HAVE SHOWN THAT PROFITS ARE THEIR ONLY GOAL. THEY WILL DO ANYTHING OT LIVING THINGS FOR PROFIT. THEY ARE POISONIJNG OUR RIVERS AND STREAMS WITH PIG MANURE, THE SMELLS ON THE AIR ARE DISGUSTING. THIS AGENCY HAS CREATED THE PITS OF THE FOOD WORLD. NO WAY DO I AGREE WITH THIS CHANGE. IT IS MINOR SO THAT IT IS NOT TRUTHFUL TO THE PUBLIC. THIS COMMENT IS FOR THE PUBLIC RECORD. THIS IS AN ATTEMPT ON THE PART OF SOME SNEAKS TO MAKE MORE MONEY BY PRETENDING TO BE ORGANIC WHEN THEY ARE NOT. ITS AGAIN ALL ABOUT MONEY. AND GREED.

RE: Comment on Proposed Rule on Origin of Livestock (Docket Number AMS-NOP-11-0009; NOP-11-04PR)<br/><br/>To Whom It May Concern:<br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to provide public input on the National Organic Programs Proposed Rule on the Origin of Livestock. I fully support the effort to close the loopholes that have allowed the continued practice of bringing conventional livestock on to organic farms. This loophole has been abused and has allowed factory farm livestock operations to manage their herds using practices that are not sustainable and do not promote the health of their livestock.<br/><br/>However, the proposed new rule appears to create a new loophole that I want to see closed to prevent the ongoing abuse of the intent and spirit of organic law.<br/><br/>Specifically, I support the following changes:<br/><br/>The rule must require that any organic dairy farm selling organic animals be a functioning commercial dairy that is inspected and permitted by the state in which it operates. Furthermore, this dairy farm must have a relationship with a licensed milk handler shipping to a licensed dairy plant. In addition, this operation should be fully established, shipping milk for no less than 180 days and any animal sold should be producing milk itself. This means that no young transitioned heifers, who have never been milked, could qualify for sale as organic.<br/><br/>Should the National Organic Program seek a definitive solution to the potential loophole noted above, they could choose to ban, outright, the sale to an organic operation of any cattle that had been transitioned from conventional production to organic production.<br/>The final rule should close the loophole for breeding stock by creating additional safeguards that would prevent rotating animals in and out of organic production and only allow periodic and limited editions for genetic diversity (prohibiting the practice of converting first litter sows to organic production on a continual basis).<br/>Thank you for considering my comments on this important matter.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Kari Kazer

WOW! Once again the government is screwing over the American public. I only feed my family organic non GMO foods and boycott Monsanto and their products. At least I felt the USDA  was keeping the title USDA certified organic true to form but the consumer is being duped again. It&#39;s so sad that no one seems to care about integrity and doing the right thing. My family eats very little animal products and Hopefully one day we will live in a country where you can trust what government organizations say and do!

I just recently surrendered my organic certification over mistreatment of the federal cost share (that I should have gotten and didn&#39;t) and have been looking closely at the program which seems to be rife with loose enforcement and loopholes (largely which serve &quot;big ag&quot;).  If this continues, there will be no integrity in the USDA Organic label at all and it&#39;s intent will backfire.  We have a health crisis largely caused by people (most especially our children) eating poor diets of processed foods loaded with fat and salt and sugar. Those more enlightened know to &quot;eat organic&quot; but if this program loses the respect of the common people then you will have failed utterly.<br/><br/>On another note: Small farmers don&#39;t have much hope unless they market directly to neighbors who not only want organic food but local food. If Big Ag can infiltrate the USDA as they have and co-opt the good name of organic food, maybe that will cause a &quot;sea change&quot; in the way we do agriculture in the future.  I myself do not trust the USDA organic label anymore and I am passionate about organic<br/>production on my farm and in what I put in my mouth.  Please close loopholes surrounding labeli

I agree with The Cornucopia Institute&#39;s suggested changes to the proposed origin of livestock rule<br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to provide public input on the National Organic Program&#39;s Proposed Rule on the Origin of Livestock. I fully support the effort to close the loophole that has allowed the continued practice of bringing in conventional cattle onto organic farms. This loophole has been abused and allowed factory farm livestock operations to manage their herds using practices that aren&#39;t sustainable and do not promote the health of their livestock.<br/><br/>However, the proposed new rule appears to to see closed to prevent the ongoing abuse of the intent and spirit of organic law.<br/><br/>Specifically, I support the following two changes:<br/>The rule must require that any organic dairy farm selling organic animals be a functioning &quot;commercial dairy&quot; that is inspected and permitted by the state in which it operates. Furthermore, this dairy farm must have a relationship with a licensed milk handler shipping to a licensed dairy plant. In addition, this operation should be fully established, shipping milk, for no less than 180 days and that any animal sold has been producing milk themselves. This means that no young transitioned heifers, who have never been milked, could qualify for sale as &quot;organic&quot;.<br/>Should the National Organic Program seek an alternative solution to the potential loophole noted above, they could choose to ban, outright, the sale to an organic operation of any cattle that had been transitioned from conventional production to organic production.<br/>Thank you for considering my comments on this important matter.<br/>

I agree with Cornucopia&#39;s position on this subject.  It is becoming more and more evident that our nation&#39;s food supply is being adversely effected by big companies and their goal to make as much money as possible regardless of the public.  Citizens are having more health problems and we the people need our government to be stricter, not more lenient, on all aspects of food growing, processing, raising and labeling.  Please help us as we try to eat natural foods with correct labels.<br/><br/>Thank you for allowing me to give my opinion.

This loophole has been abused and has allowed factory farm livestock operations to manage their herds using practices that are not sustainable and do not promote the health of their livestock.<br/><br/>However, the proposed new rule appears to create a new loophole that I want to see closed to prevent the ongoing abuse of the intent and spirit of organic law.<br/><br/>Specifically, I support the following changes:<br/><br/>    The rule must require that any organic dairy farm selling organic animals be a functioning commercial dairy that is inspected and permitted by the state in which it operates.

Predominately corporations have the money to throw at influencing legislation to foster their all important bottom line. Small farmers do not have this luxury. Consumers do not have this luxury. And yet it is the consumer and the small family operation who are sacrificed to the bottom line. The food supply, the health of this nation&#39;s soil and the health care costs the American people should be the paramount consideration, not some corporate bottom line. I urge you to move in a direction that delivers more transparency, more responsibility, more intellectual acknowledgement of the connection between our food and our health.  <br/><br/>Thank you for considering my comments on this important matter.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Dana McEndree

ORGANIC MEANS ORGANIC and non-organic give-aways are<br/>diluting the intent and purity of the organic philosophy, which consumers like me live by.  Health reasons determine why people choose organic and it is NECESSARY that organic sources be<br/>from sources of integrity.

To be quite frank, I am sickened, appalled, and totally disgusted with the fact that my government is consistently caving in to big business and going against the will of millions of health-conscious citizens who want pure and healthy food and the right to know exactly what is in the food that they consume.  Here is yet another proposed action by a federal agency which goes against what health-conscious consumers want.<br/><br/>I give up.  You people are so disgustingly corrupt.  I highly recommend that you study spiritual teachings of whatever discipline you feel affinity to, regarding how we should treat other human beings.  But my guess is that you are too arrogant to really care about anything except your own greedy interests.<br/><br/>I&#39;m really sorry, it seems like whoever was responsible for teaching you basic human values - your parents, your teachers, your mentors - have completely failed.<br/><br/>Now you are intent upon destroying organics and the freedoms and rights of the millions of people who choose not to consume the poisons and crap proffered by the big companies you are working for.<br/><br/>Shame on you.

The concept of transitioning a conventionally-raised cow to an organic dairy is contradictory to the concept of an organic dairy, and should be banned.<br/><br/>Specifically, I support the following change.<br/><br/>* The sale of conventionally raised cattle to an organic diary should be banned; or if it occurs, it should invalidate the organic certification of the dairy until all conventionally raised cattle are removed from the dairy and the milk from those cattle may not be sold as organic milk.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering my comments on this important matter.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Charles E. McCarthy<br/>

RE: Comment on Proposed Rule on Origin of Livestock (Docket Number AMS-NOP-11-0009; NOP-11-04PR)<br/><br/>To Whom It May Concern:<br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to provide public input on the National Organic Program&#39;s Proposed Rule on the Origin of Livestock. I fully support the effort to close the loophole that has allowed the continued practice of bringing in conventional cattle onto organic farms. This loophole has been abused and allowed factory farm livestock operations to manage their herds using practices that aren&#39;t sustainable and do not promote the health of their livestock.<br/><br/>However, the proposed new rule appears to to see closed to prevent the ongoing abuse of the intent and spirit of organic law.<br/><br/>Specifically, I support the following two changes:<br/><br/>The rule must require that any organic dairy farm selling organic animals be a functioning &quot;commercial dairy&quot; that is inspected and permitted by the state in which it operates. Furthermore, this dairy farm must have a relationship with a licensed milk handler shipping to a licensed dairy plant. In addition, this operation should be fully established, shipping milk, for no less than 180 days and that any animal sold has been producing milk themselves. This means that no young transitioned heifers, who have never been milked, could qualify for sale as &quot;organic&quot;.<br/><br/>Should the National Organic Program seek an alternative solution to the potential loophole noted above, they could choose to ban, outright, the sale to an organic operation of any cattle that had been transitioned from conventional production to organic production.<br/>Thank you for considering my comments on this important matter.<br/><br/>Sincerely,

<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>My family and I struggle to raise , grow and buy organic products to promote our health and well being and we urge you to close the loophole that allows conventional cattle onto organic dairy farms, even one time. This practice compromises everyone who tries so hard to do the right thing and go truly organic. From the dairy farmers to the consumers, organic is the responsible way to go. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>It will have added benefits of reducing all the antibiotics , pesticides and herbicides not only in our dairy products but in our soil and water which everyone depends on for our very lives. <br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Our family agrees with the Cornucopia Institute in this and many other topics. All the chemicals and drugs mentioned above put us all at risk by polluting our soil , water and our bodies and represent a major threat to the food security of all Americans.  We need to trust that foods labeled &quot;organic&quot; are in fact truly organic.  Thank you for letting our family voice our opinion.

This is absolute nonsense. Everything these days is about money &amp; appeasing the conglomerates so they can get a loophole to a law that is supposed to protect the public &amp; children of our nation. I hereby request that no one time livestock conversion, or any change that would loosen the organic labeling requirements, as detailed in this proposal, be allowed now, or ever. Please, for once, put the public &amp; children&#39;s interest ahead of everything else &amp; do the right thing.

This seems pretty common sense. ONCE means once. Close this loophole, otherwise transitioning conventional cows to organic ones will be abused by factory farmed organic producers. This is about being open and transparent to the consumer. When someone buys organic they want to pay for what they get and not the appearance of pure organic dairy/meat. Thank you for your time.

To Whom It May Concern:<br/><br/>RE: The National Organic Program&#39;s Proposed Rule on the Origin of Livestock. <br/><br/>I support closing the loophole that allows conventional cattle on organic farms. This has allowed factory farm livestock operations to manage their herds using practices that aren&#39;t sustainable and do not promote the health of their livestock.<br/><br/>The new proposed rule would create a new loophole that should be closed to prevent the ongoing abuse of the intent and spirit of organic law.<br/><br/>Please make these changes<br/><br/>The rule should require that any organic dairy farm selling organic animals be a functioning &quot;commercial dairy&quot; that&#39;s inspected and permitted by the state that it&#39;s in. The dairy should have a relationship with a licensed milk handler shipping to a licensed dairy plant. <br/><br/>The dairy must be shipping milk, for no less than 180 days and that any animal sold has been producing milk itself. So no young transitioned heifers, who have never been milked, should ever qualify for sale as &quot;organic&quot;.<br/><br/>Alternatively, the National Organic Program could choose to ban the sale to an organic operation of any cattle that had been transitioned from conventional production to organic production.<br/><br/>Thank you.

I agree totally...with the Cornucopia Institute&#39;s stance on this Program.. Cornucopia stance:<br/><br/>Require the farm to be a commercial dairy, that is inspected and permitted by the state, and that has a relationship with a licensed milk handler shipping to a licensed dairy plant. Furthermore, the operation should be fully established, shipping milk for no less than 180 days; any animal sold must be producing milk themselves (no young transitioned heifers, who have never been milked, could qualify to be sold as &quot;organic&quot;).<br/><br/>As put forth by the Northeast Organic Dairy Producers Alliance, to prevent abuse a simpler and even more powerful solution would be to ban, outright, the sale to an organic operation of any cattle that had been transitioned from conventional production to organic production.

This country is ridiculous! Conventional cows should not be allowed on an organic farm. I am sick and tired of fighting over the right to consume food that is tainted with toxic chemicals. I agree with all comments submitted by the Cornucopia Institute. I expect this law not to pass.

Thank you for the opportunity to provide public input on the National Organic Program&#39;s Proposed Rule on the Origin of Livestock. I fully support the effort to close the loophole that has allowed the continued practice of bringing in conventional cattle onto organic farms. This loophole has been abused and allowed factory farm livestock operations to manage their herds using practices that aren&#39;t sustainable and do not promote the health of their livestock.<br/><br/>However, the proposed new rule appears to to see closed to prevent the ongoing abuse of the intent and spirit of organic law.<br/><br/>Specifically, I support the following two changes:<br/><br/>The rule must require that any organic dairy farm selling organic animals be a functioning &quot;commercial dairy&quot; that is inspected and permitted by the state in which it operates. Furthermore, this dairy farm must have a relationship with a licensed milk handler shipping to a licensed dairy plant. In addition, this operation should be fully established, shipping milk, for no less than 180 days and that any animal sold has been producing milk themselves. This means that no young transitioned heifers, who have never been milked, could qualify for sale as &quot;organic&quot;.<br/><br/>Should the National Organic Program seek an alternative solution to the potential loophole noted above, they could choose to ban, outright, the sale to an organic operation of any cattle that had been transitioned from conventional production to organic production.<br/>Thank you for considering my comments on this important matter.

Organic dairy cows should be raised on organic feed and according to organic standards.<br/>Factory farms will continue to try and destroy the organic standards because of greed - want the money but not follow the rules.<br/>Factory farms should be against the law. It is a terrible life for the animals and causes pollution.<br/>Please protect the organic standards and go after the violators!!!!!!!<br/>Born, raised and live on a farm.<br/>So I know what real healthy food is and people should not have to be afraid of their food killing them -the beef and chicken contamination just to mention a few!!!

Please see attached file(s) for a letter from many of the organic dairy goat producers.<br/><br/>Some states only have one organic dairy goat producer. It would be a great burden to increase their herds or improve their<br/>genetics. Finding organic goats to purchase is very hard. Trying to find organic goats that are disease free (CAE and CL <br/>especially) is almost impossible. This rule would force some producers to bring degenerative diseases into their herds.<br/>Thank you for giving us, the few organic goat producers in the U.S., this opportunity to voice our concerns.

This loophole has been abused and allowed factory farm livestock operations to manage their herds using practices that aren&#39;t sustainable and do not promote the health of their livestock.<br/><br/>However, the proposed new rule appears to to see closed to prevent the ongoing abuse of the intent and spirit of organic law.<br/><br/>Specifically, I support the following two changes:<br/><br/>The rule must require that any organic dairy farm selling organic animals be a functioning &quot;commercial dairy&quot; that is inspected and permitted by the state in which it operates. Furthermore, this dairy farm must have a relationship with a licensed milk handler shipping to a licensed dairy plant. In addition, this operation should be fully established, shipping milk, for no less than 180 days and that any animal sold has been producing milk themselves. This means that no young transitioned heifers, who have never been milked, could qualify for sale as &quot;organic&quot;.<br/><br/>Should the National Organic Program seek an alternative solution to the potential loophole noted above, they could choose to ban, outright, the sale to an organic operation of any cattle that had been transitioned from conventional production to organic production.<br/>Thank you for considering my comments on this important matter.<br/><br/>I agree with the Cornucopia Institutes suggested changes to the proposed origin of livestock rule stated above!<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Laura Steinberg<br/><br/>

Hello,<br/>I support the following two suggested changes from The Cornucopia Institute:<br/><br/>The rule must require that any organic dairy farm selling organic animals be a functioning &quot;commercial dairy&quot; that is inspected and permitted by the state in which it operates. Furthermore, this dairy farm must have a relationship with a licensed milk handler shipping to a licensed dairy plant. In addition, this operation should be fully established, shipping milk, for no less than 180 days and that any animal sold has been producing milk themselves. This means that no young transitioned heifers, who have never been milked, could qualify for sale as &quot;organic&quot;.<br/><br/>Should the National Organic Program seek an alternative solution to the potential loophole noted above, they could choose to ban, outright, the sale to an organic operation of any cattle that had been transitioned from conventional production to organic production.<br/>Thank you for considering my comments.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Marija Santos

I am a 4th generation dairy farmer. We certified to be organic 10years ago. There are many rules that make complete sense and some that don&#39;t. The livestock origin rule is one I have a hard time with. Once you are certified there is no way to acquire new animals unless buying them from another organic farm, which is not awful unless you don&#39;t have the ability. Whether it is due to costs or closeness to your farm it can be impossible to purchase organically. I agree with this rule in part. It makes sense to not allow animals that are 12month or that are bred to be bought and transitioned, but it doesn&#39;t make much sense to me to not allow younger stock to be purchased. It would increase the number of organic animals, but still have over a year before they would be milked. I would propose that say an animal 6months or younger could be bought and permanently identified as transitioned so that the animal could not be sold for meat or fiber organically. Whether that is by brand or tattoo is fine. Then the animal can be used for organic milk production and her offspring would be 100% since she would be on an already certified farm.

You should require farms to be a commercial dairy, that is inspected and permitted by the state, and that has a relationship with a licensed milk handler shipping to a licensed dairy plant. Furthermore, the operation should be fully established, shipping milk for no less than 180 days; any animal sold must be producing milk themselves (no young transitioned heifers, who have never been milked, could qualify to be sold as &quot;organic&quot;).<br/>And, as put forth by the Northeast Organic Dairy Producers Alliance, ban, outright, the sale to an organic operation of any cattle that had been transitioned from conventional production to organic production.<br/>

The organic exemption from federal check-off programs is important to organic agriculture; and the rules need to be put in place as quickly as possible.<br/> These rules give the same opportunity to farms and businesses with split operations (organic and non-organic) as 100% organic operations were granted in the 2002 Farm Bill to request a refund on organic sales assessments. This change corrects unequal treatment of organic certificate holders set by the 2002 Farm Bill. <br/> This exemption will provide a level playing field. It allows organically certified farmers and handlers to use check-off monies to benefit their own operations and future, similar to the benefit that non-organic operations receive from being assessed under the Commodity Promotion Law. <br/> Organics is less than 5% of agricultural production and requires very specific research and marketing. Farmers and handlers carry out a high percentage of direct-to-consumer and other marketing, or conduct research on their own farms. <br/> The exemption process should be as efficient as possible. Information on certified organic operations is now available in real time so certificate holders should only need to apply once for an exemption from the check-off, not every year. Commodity boards can be informed by the NOP when the operation loses its organic certification. <br/> Organics should have a blanket exemption from all Research and Promotion programs. <br/> For Marketing Orders, the organic exemption should be the marketing portion average of all AMS Marketing Orders.

It is well known that organic products protect workers, soil, water and environment. I buy them almost exclusively. Thus I was grateful to learn that legislation will protect them.<br/><br/>Please keep the process of applying for the exemption from the commodity promotion program as simple as possible in order to encourage organic farming. The agency should grant a blanket exemption from all research and promotion programs and from the average marketing portion of all Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) Marketing Orders.<br/><br/>Do not allow lobbyists to convince you that non-organic commodities will be harmed.

I support this effort in giving organic farmers an equal opportunity to succeed. While conventional farmers are rewarded for polluting the environment, poisoning our food supply, and starving the world by growing non-food crops like field corn, organic farmers are cleaning the environment, providing natural food supplies, and feeding the world through increased food quality and increased biodiversity. <br/>For too long conventional farmers have enjoyed subsidies and other government assistance that has enforced the status quo rather than fuel innovation. Please continue to give organic farmers every chance to compete against conventional agriculture. This should be only the beginning!

Docket Clerk<br/>Marketing Order and Agreement Division<br/>Fruit and Vegetable Program<br/>AMS, USDA<br/>1400 Independence Avenue, SW<br/>Washington, DC 20250-0237<br/><br/>Re:<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Document Number AMS-FV-14-0032; FRN December 16, 2014, Page 75006; Exemption of Organic Products From Assessment Under a Commodity Promotion Law<br/><br/>The United Dairy Industry Association (UDIA) submits the following comments on the Proposed Rule to modify the organic assessment exemption regulations applicable to the Dairy Research and Promotion Program:<br/><br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The Proposed Rule should explicitly state that the organic exemption applies only to the national dairy promotion program.  It is important that producers claiming the exemption understand that obtaining a certificate of exemption from assessment under the new organic exemption regulations will not exempt those producers from any state dairy promotion law or regulation that requires the payment of assessments to a state or regional program. This is not clear from the text of the Proposed Rule and should be clarified.  UDIA suggests adding a subparagraph (5) to section 1150.157(a) that states the following:<br/><br/>The exemption shall apply only to payment of assessments under this part.  Any producer so exempted shall continue to be obligated to pay assessments required by any state statute or regulation applicable to that producer.<br/><br/>2.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>The Proposed Rule provides for a partial exemption from Marketing Order Program assessments, but a full exemption from Research and Promotion Program assessments.  That discrepancy is fundamentally unfair to Research and Promotion Programs, and, if the Proposed Rule is enacted, will result in those Research and Promotion Programs receiving less assessment funds than they would if the Proposed Rule provided for a partial exemption from Research and Promotion Program assessments.  On page 75014, the Proposed Rule revises Section 900.700, which is applicable to Marketing Order Programs,  to state the following in relevant part: This section specifies criteria for identifying persons eligible to obtain an exemption from the portion of the assessment used to fund marketing promotion activities under a marketing order.  Thus, under the Proposed Rule, a handler subject to a Marketing Order can only be exempt from paying the portion of the assessment used to fund marketing promotion activities, which AMS estimates to be sixty percent (60%). See pg. 75009 (The handler would be exempted from 100 percent of the portion of the marketing order assessment attributed to marketing promotion activities (60 percent).).  The handler remains obligated to pay the remaining portion of the assessment.  <br/><br/>The Proposed Rule treats Research and Promotion Programs far differently.  For example, on page 75016, the Proposed Rule revises Section 1150.157, which is applic

Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)s Proposed Rule, Exemption of Organic Products From Assessment Under a Commodity Promotion Law (Proposed Rule), and as a supporter of the National Organic Coalition, I also support the Proposed Rule and a recommendation for improvement.<br/><br/>The Proposed Rule Carries Out the Bi-Partisan Directive to Expand and Make Consistent Exemptions from Commodity Promotion Programs for All Certified-Organic Producers.<br/><br/>As USDA is aware, the Proposed Rule is a result of a bi-partisan vote of Congress supporting the expansion of the organic assessment exemption within the Agricultural Act of 2014 (2014 Farm Bill). With the passage of this bipartisan bill, Congress sought to ensure that the commodity promotion exemption for organic producers established under 2002 amendments to the Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (FAIR Act) applied to organically-certified producers.<br/><br/>While previous exemptions only applied to 100% organic producers, the Proposed Rule makes the important shift toward providing organically-certified operations that also market non-organic products (split operations) with the same opportunity to be exempt from paying into any conventional research and marketing programs and the marketing portion of any market orders as those operations that are 100% organic. The Proposed Rule helps to correct the false distinction between split operations and 100% organic producers, which gave some organically-certified farmers and handlers an exemption, but not all certified operations, despite the fact that there is no difference in their organic certification status.<br/><br/>The Proposed Rule Will Not Negatively Impact Conventional Commodity Promotions.<br/><br/>The Proposed Rule Enables Even Broader Support of Grassroots Organic Research and Marketing<br/><br/>One-Time Application for an Exemption -The Proposed Rule Needs to Increase Efficiency and Reduces Eligibility Burdens for Commodity Promotion Program Exemption Applications and Administration.<br/><br/>The National Organic Program (NOP) recently upgraded its system to have information on all certified organic operations available in real time. Capitalizing on this positive technological advancement, the Proposed Rule should increase efficiency and eligibility by taking into account the fact that the commodity programs are all housed within USDA and ensuring that certified organic operations need only apply once for exemption. By cross referencing the records within USDA, the veracity of the claim for continued exemption can be verified with a trigger to inform the appropriate commodity Boards if and when the operation loses its organic certification. The organic certificate continues until it is revoked by USDA/NOP. Having to apply only once for exemption will particularly benefit small businesses that make up over 75% of certified organic operations that are subject

I am a certified organic producer of field crops and beef cattle.  I would like to see my farm products be exempt from the check off programs.  The check off programs work to promote conventional agriculture products and practices.  They do little to promote niche markets such as grass-fed beef, organic beef, and organic field crops thus I benefit very little from them.

Any actions we can take to promote sustainable organic farming vs. chemical intensive factory farming methods should be taken. All the evidence shows that factory farms are depleting the soils of nutrients, accelerating soil erosion AND global climate change, and exposing farm workers and surrounding communities to dangerous levels of pesticides that end up leaving traces on the food we all eat. This trend has also lead to more unhealthy GMO crops which most Americans are opposed to. Please do all you can to honor the wishes of the citizens and help, not hinder, the organic food industry&#39;s growth since that is the only sane path.

January 31, 2015 <br/><br/>Re: Proposed Rule regarding Exemption of Organic Products From Assessment Under a Commodity Promotion Law; Docket No. AMS-FV-14-0032-0001 <br/><br/>Dear Sir/Madam: <br/>Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)s Proposed Rule: Exemption of Organic Products From Assessment Under a Commodity Promotion Law (Proposed Rule), and to express my support of the Proposed Rule as well as a recommendation for improvement. <br/>The Proposed Rule makes the important shift toward providing organically-certified operations that also market non-organic products (split operations) with the same opportunity to be exempt from paying into any conventional research and marketing programs and the marketing portion of any market orders as those operations that are 100% organic. The Proposed Rule helps to correct the false distinction between split operations and 100% organic producers, which gave some organically-certified farmers and handlers an exemption, but not all certified operations, despite the fact that there is no difference in their organic certification status.<br/><br/>In Favor of a One-Time Application for an Exemption -The Proposed Rule Needs to Increase Efficiency and Reduce Eligibility Burdens for Commodity Promotion Program Exemption Applications and Administration. <br/>The National Organic Program (NOP) recently upgraded its system to have information on all certified organic operations available in real time. Capitalizing on this positive technological advancement, the Proposed Rule should increase efficiency and eligibility by taking into account the fact that the commodity programs are all housed within USDA and ensuring that certified organic operations need only apply once for exemption. By cross referencing the records within USDA, the veracity of the claim for continued exemption can be verified with a trigger to inform the appropriate commodity Boards if and when the operation loses its organic certification. The organic certificate continues until it is revoked by USDA/NOP. Having to apply only once for exemption will particularly benefit small businesses that make up over 75% of certified organic operations that are subject to a high paperwork burden because of their organic certification. Additionally, for many commodities the organic program purchasing verification requirement provides yet another reason to support one-time exemption applications as purchasers of agricultural product are required to confirm annually that the farmer has a valid organic certificate and they are also required to deduct any commodity promotion program payment. The exemption from the commodity promotion program should not be unduly complicated or burdensome on small businesses. It must be a blanket exemption from all research and promotion programs and from the average marketing portion of all Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) Marketing Orders.

The net loss in assessment revenue to the USPB is estimated at approximately $38,770.00. Of significant note, several of these operations currently utilize USPB marketing and promotion materials on their organic product packaging and in their organic marketing efforts. This new rule, should it be implemented, would prevent these growers from continuing to use USPB promotional materials on their organic products, thereby losing the marketing leverage of USPB programs to help promote their organic products. One grower, whose operation is approximately 80% organic, and serves on the International Marketing Committee of the USPB Administrative Committee, has commented previously he believes USPB programs effectively promote his organic potato products just as much as they do his non-organic potato products. He views the USPB programs as effectively promoting all potato sectors, regardless of how his potatoes are grown.<br/><br/>In summary, the USPB believes this proposed rule is unnecessary, as it applies to the Potato Research and Promotion Program, as so many organic operations continue to support the USPBs work by utilizing USPB promotional materials on their organic products and in their organic marketing programs. Should this rule become final, and split operations do apply for the exemption, they will no longer be able to use USPB marketing materials in support of their organic products and marketing programs, thereby losing the marketing leverage of USPB programs to help promote their organic products. Further, the proposed rule, if finalized, would reduce USPB assessment collections by an estimated $38,770.00 annually.<br/><br/>For the foregoing reasons, the United States

I believe that this is a great step for the Organic markets, to provide a level of exemption from extreme regulation that may add extra costs to the smaller scale farmers that typically are in the Organic markets.<br/><br/>I have a little over three years experience in Organic, Permaculture based farming, and I am planning to purchase a farm, roughly 20-25 acres this year in North Carolina.  I believe that enough regulation exists to provide protections for consumers and to ensure that Organic quality products are known and checked to be what they are sold as, but I believe that providing extra layers of oversight that require constant quantification, and inventory analysis of the farm products can be a hindrance for many.  I, personally, will be implementing a process of quantification, because I believe firmly in the capabilities of Permaculture, and seek to be another cog in the process of helping America free itself from industrial Agriculture, for both the benefit of the environment, and the health of our people.  Some farmers are not at this same level that I believe myself to be at;  They are working small homestead projects while farming for the ability to continue funding their personal comfort and ability to leave with relative ease.  It is a hard job being an Organic farmer, and we already deal with struggles against cross pollination from Monsanto crops, potential for market crashes on certain products (of which crop insurance will prove to be greatly helpful), and the inevitability of us having to find our own markets, and sell our own produce.  I believe that we should definitely be thinking of how to protect consumers, but I believe that the consumers themselves are misunderstanding the market, as better off in a globalized scale.  Globalization is certainly an aspect of our world that all of us deal with on a daily basis, but for us to farm and distribute food in a globalized structure will prove to be heavily polluting to our world, and will cause the nutritious foods that we grow to lose some of their nutritive value in time.<br/><br/>I firmly support growing local organics, for local &quot;Megacities,&quot; and I believe that in such &quot;Slow-grow local&quot; styles, we will find easement in our continued mission to provide people with healthy food, and provide a healthy Earth. <br/><br/>Thank you for your time,<br/>Stephen J.

It is important to give organic farmers an equal opportunity to succeed. Organic farmers produce food which is healthy and they do so in a sustainable fashion which increases the fertility of the ground and does not pollute our earth or our water.  For too long, conventional farming techniques, which pollute the environment and poisoning our food.  The plant denatured seeds and spray the earth with cancer causing chemicals.   The government has been promoting the damaging  conventional farming techniques with subsidies and other government assistance that has enforced the ineffective agricultural techniques rather than stand for ethical forward movement.

My name is Troy Brown, President, of Kretz Lumber Co., Inc located in Antigo, WI.  These are my original comments and I stand by them today.<br/>There are a few things that are wrong with the proposed Hardwood Check-off program that I wish to point out.<br/>First and foremost, we live in the greatest country in the world.  What made this country great was the forethought of our founding fathers to establish a government that allows me the freedom to choose.  The reason that this program has gotten this far is that there are those of us that would choose not to participate in this unified program based on our beliefs and assumptions that we will not see higher profits from this program.  <br/>Second, our government should not be appointed to regulate anything.  Our government in a true capitalistic society should be protecting our property from thieves, our lives from those who wish to harm us, and our liberties.  One of the reasons for establishing our own government, stated in the Declaration of Independence sent to the King of England in 1776 was; For imposing taxes on us without our consent.<br/>Finally, Amendment V of the constitution states that nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.  We cannot equate that we will receive just compensation for paying into this program.  It is too subjective.  What one may deem just compensation another will not believe that they have received just compensation.  Therefore, if I believe I am not receiving just compensation and I am forced to contribute to the Hardwood Check-off program, it is violating my rights as established in Amendment V of the United States Constitution and in essence stealing my private property if I choose that I do not support this proposed tax assessment.<br/>Therefore as the President of Kretz Lumber Co., Inc. and its representative in this matter we oppose the proposed Hardwood Check-off program.  Additionally, on the premise of the law that is stated above, I recommend to the U.S. Department of Agriculture that the Hardwood Check-off program not be taken to the level of referendum.<br/>

I work for a large vertically integrated Hardwood Lumber company based out of West Virginia and have been in the industry for 15 years.  I have truly enjoyed the experiences I&#39;ve had and the relationships I&#39;ve forged.  In short it is a great business to be involved with.  During that time, however, I have seen our industry face challenges from a number of competing products and industries that are better organized and able to market their products more effectively.  The Hardwood lumber industry is not an industry made up of large corporations but primarily multiple small family run businesses.  I think the Hardwood Checkoff is a tremendous opportunity for the industry to come together and pool their resources to better position our products in this new global marketplace.  I support this program and hope it comes to a vote sooner then later and is passed.<br/>

I have read many of the comments to the USDA and have to wonder why no one has mentioned the other forestry checkoffs which have been passed overwhelmingly and already up and running.  These include paper and paperboard, softwood lumber, and Christmas trees.  What is it about hardwood lumber that makes us less in need of the programs?  It seems to me we have MORE of a connection to consumers who watch HGTV and read decorating magazines than any of these forest products.  We should have been the first to have a checkoff, not the last.  I respectfully request that USDA give our industry a vote immediately on the Hardwood Checkoff and will work to have it passed.

I am in favor of the Hardwood Checkoff.  I have been in the wood flooring business for 35 years now.  During that time I have seen a resurgence in market demand for wood flooring but also a number of substitute products that have come into the market with a wood visual but not made out of wood.  Increasingly these products steal business from real wood floors.  I am talking about Plastic Laminate, Luxury Vinyl Tile and Ceramic Tile digitally printed to look like wood.  These product are looking more and more like the real thing but they are not the real thing. Lots of money is being spent by the makers of these substitute products to mislead the consumer into perceiving them as real wood while we are do very little to counter their claims.<br/><br/>The second thing that I have witnessed is the amount of wood flooring and other wood products that are sourced overseas in areas that are notorious for illegal logging.  Products made from wood sourced in these areas are not competing on a level playing field with product made from American hardwoods.  The rule of law prevails in America and you cannot lower your raw material cost by using stolen wood.  Land in America is privately owned and you cannot bribe law enforcement here to let you cut down someone else&#39;s forest without paying the rightful owner. The consequences ripple all the way through the supply chain and affect jobs and taxes here in our country. The consumer needs to hear that our products are legal and sustainable.<br/><br/>The American forest is growing more hardwood timber now than at any time in the last hundred years.  All U.S.states are growing more hardwood each year than is being harvested or dieing naturally.  There is twice as much hardwood volume in the U.S. today as fifty years ago according to U.S. Forest Service statics.  This is not the case in most tropical areas of the world where forests are being depleted at alarming rates. Tropical deforestation is blamed for increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.<br/><br/>We need to tell the American hardwood story to the consumer.  We have a genuine, time tested product, that supports our domestic economy and is naturally renewing.  It is the original green product.  Telling this story is too big a job for one company or even one industry to tackle effectively on their own. We need the power of a sustained program with a consistent message.  We have seen Checkoffs work in other industries with other agricultural products.  We need the Hardwood Checkoff to ensure our children&#39;s future.

Im writing in support of the Hardwood Checkoff and encourage the USDA to publish the draft order for an industry vote this year.  Our industry has debated the merits of a checkoff for 5 years.  Meanwhile our market share has eroded.  Given our highly fragmented industry and underfunded trade associations, our hardwood marketing initiatives have not reached designers, specifiers, building professionals or the general consumer.  We need a unified message with sustainable funding.  The American Hardwood Export Council (AHEC) promoting American hardwoods overseas proves consistent long-term promotion can move the needle.  When speaking with one unified voice vs. thousands of independent companies, everyone benefits through increased market demand, consumer awareness, and public education regarding our renewable hardwood resource.  The softwood and paper sector have already approved checkoffs and have ongoing programs.  With a sustained long-term and proactive marketing approach we can rebrand hardwoods as aesthetically pleasing, sustainable and renewable.  We could afford life cycle analysis and comparative analysis of hardwoods vs. competing materials.  For many decades, our industry trade associations have lacked funding for either promotion or research.  Trade association and state forestry budgets are contracting.  Only a small percentage of mills voluntarily support industry research and promotion.  We need a promotion war chest and a developmental pipeline for new applications such as thermo-modified lumber.<br/><br/>Plywood Inclusion in Checkoff<br/>I do not agree with concerns by some sawmill producers on the issue of including plywood in the Checkoff.   I believe plywood producers would be benefactors of any hardwood checkoff.  Kitchen cabinetry, store fixtures, and architectural millwork all routinely include plywood products and help drive greater lumber usage.  The plywood sector should pay their fair share of the hardwood marketing expense.  AHEC has promoted generic hardwoods including hardwood veneer and plywood for over 15 years.  No one has objected beforehand.  The intent of an industry checkoff is to grow the overall hardwood pie.  Competing substitute products such as luxury vinyl tile and melamines are aggressively eroding our markets.  Without a unified voice and sustainable funding, our message is unheard.<br/><br/>Assessment<br/>In reference to value-added producers, I believe the revised draft language has mistakenly included a mechanism for imputing value of lumber produced internally which is not necessary.  Green and/or air dried lumber should be treated as the first step in the value chain.  Kiln drying is the second step.  Additional integrated value-added producers such as flooring manufacturers, moulding producers, etc. are the third step in the value chain.  Concentration kiln yards or sawmills buying outside lumber, and value-added producers should all be given the same credit for lumber already assessed in the first

My name is Larry Hunter. I work for Pike Lumber Company  <br/>Inc. I have been with Pike Lumber for 43 years. Pike will be <br/>included in the Hardwood Checkoff and I am excited to support the program. Hardwood manufacturing is a strong, reliable US industry and has been for many, many years. We are currently facing challenges from competing products better able to fund promotion, marketing, and new product development. We are not an industry made up of huge corporations. Many of our companies are family businesses and have continued through the years with hard work and determination. We must come together as so many other commodities have done and pass a Checkoff for our industry. I personally recommend that this Checkoff program be implemented as soon as possible.<br/><br/>

We need to get the good news about hardwoods to consumers.  Right now they don&#39;t have a clue how healthy our hardwood forests are and how diverse, beautiful and environmentally beneficial utilizing hardwood products are.<br/>  <br/>Opponents and proponents of this order agree our industry needs to educate and promote hardwood products to consumers, and research new hardwood uses/methods of harvesting/manufacturing that will benefit all.  We agree that all stake holders from timberland owners to hardwood product manufacturers small and large will financially benefit when consumers realize the amazing diversity, quality and characteristics hardwoods offer, and buy more hardwoods.  Our industry, small and large companies will benefit as more consumers learn the incredible environmental benefits utilizing hardwoods gives, and buy more hardwoods.<br/>   <br/>Since this &quot;check-off&quot; process started, other building materials have taken market share from traditional hardwood uses.  Hardwood values have gone on a roller coaster ride, at least in part as demand switched to other materials who present a unified message to consumers.   Other agricultural producers, small to large have benefited from their check-off program, it&#39;s time to try ours.<br/><br/>This proposed order is the natural step to fund accomplishing the common goals all hardwood stake holders have, a more stable, diverse and growing demand for hardwood products.  If it passes now, five years from now we&#39;ll be renewing it.<br/><br/>

As a small hardwood sawmill, we are not in favor of the Hardwood Check-Off.  The burden for this TAX will rest almost solely on the hardwood sawmills, while the wholesaler will only pay a small percent of the tax levied on the lumber purchased from the sawmill.  Indiana has one of the largest populations of small family owned sawmills, and we are at this point struggling to make ends meet, with Group Health Insurance, Workers Comp, General Liability insurance, all increasing at a rapid rate; this tax would force many to shut down their businesses.<br/><br/>An elite group of Lumbermen came up with this idea, to help them pay for their advertising. <br/><br/>We are not in favor of the Hardwood Lumber Check-off. <br/><br/>Ford Frick<br/>Frick Lumber Co., Inc.<br/>Brimfield, Indiana

I previously submitted comments with my opposition to the original Order in 2013/2014. Many others also submitted comments that I agreed with that reinforced my opposition. Nothing that I can understand from these proposed revisions has changed my opinion. Either the concerns I had were not address to my satisfaction, or they are difficult to discern from the way they are being presented. For example:<br/><br/>In the Revised Order, under the Referenda heading, it states:  USDA is proposing to modify the referenda criteria as specified in the November 2013 proposed rule in paragraphs (a) and (b) of proposed 1211.81 to require approval by a majority of manufacturers voting in the referendum who also represent a majority of the volume (board foot or equivalent) of covered hardwood, represented in the referendum and by those who, during a representative period determined by the Secretary, were engaged in the manufacturing of covered hardwood.<br/><br/>What exactly is this saying? Is it a weighted vote or one vote for one company?<br/><br/>The National Hardwood Lumber Association, whom remains neutral on this issue, issued a release to its members trying to inform them of the Revised Hardwood Lumber and Hardwood Plywood Promotion, Research and information Order. After their comments about the voting changes, they stated (Note: We asked USDA for clarification on this and were told there would be none until after the comments)<br/><br/>How can I make an informed comment about this proposal if the USDA will not clarify this important issue? <br/><br/>I can comment on the hardwood plywood inclusion. Plywood is a direct competitor of my solid hardwood products. They should not be included in any form.   <br/><br/>My comments about the assessments are not directed solely at the computation. My original opposition to this Order was that the under $2,000,000 in sales manufacturers were exempt. Now even more hardwood manufacturers will not have to pay. Any way you calculate it, either everyone pays or no one does.<br/><br/>I continue to oppose the original Order and the Revised Order. None of these proposed revisions has changed my mind.<br/><br/>Bucky Pescaglia<br/>President<br/>Missouri-Pacific Lumber Co, Inc.<br/>

Check-off programs are a proven, cost-effective way for an industry to promote their products and conduct research on new uses and opportunities for their goods. These programs are designed by the industry themselves, and the funds are controlled by the industry themselves. The benefits accrue to the industry and their employees through increased markets and sales. Dozens of other industries have used these programs to grow markets and improve their competitiveness.

I have been in the hardwood industry for 17 years and work for Allegheny Wood Products, which will be included in the Hardwood Checkoff program. I strongly urge the USDA to allow the hardwood industry to vote on the hardwood checkoff proposal as soon as possible. We need to pass this program and immediately build initiatives to strengthen our competitive position in tough markets worldwide.  We have tried voluntary efforts and have shown that these do not work.   <br/><br/>Thank your for the consideration.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Jerry N. Litton Jr.

I am in full support of the Hardwood Checkoff program. Our industry needs the revenue to promote and educate hardwood to the end users. With going &quot;Green&quot; being such a hot topic, people need to be educated that it doesn&#39;t get any more &quot;Green&quot; than hardwood. It is time to bring it to a vote.

The proposed Hardwood Lumber and Hardwood Plywood Checkoff, as it is now presented, is a water-down version of an idea that was conceived during the worst financial downturn any of us working in the business today has ever seen.  Decisions that will have long lasting impacts are usually not well thought through during times of turmoil.  The Proposal, if adopted as now written, will raise very little money (at least for a meaningful promotional program) and will be administered by a board that has far too many people on it to make good decisions.  <br/><br/>Some claim that we should try it and if we don&#39;t like it, we&#39;ll just change it or get rid of it.  The process that we&#39;re all still talking about has taken 6 or 7 years from conception to this point.  How long might it take the industry to change or eliminate what is set in motion now?  One thing is for certain, we&#39;ll all still be paying each year as the changes or elimination debate goes along.<br/><br/>Without the proposed Checkoff our industry will go through good times and not such good times, as it always has.  Does anyone actually believe this Proposal, as now written, will have any impact of the prosperity of our industry?  Does anyone believe the small quantity of money that will be generated and then split up many ways for many pet ideas will have any impact on the laws of Supply and Demand that rule our industry  I for one, do not!  I OPPOSE the Hardwood Lumber and Hardwood Lumber Checkoff

This morning I read the Washington Post article about the paper checkoff and all of the great ads targeting my millennial age group.  As a first time homebuyer I believe this same type of program is needed for the hardwood industry.  As I was going to open houses I heard few good things about solid hardwood products except for hardwood floors which sometimes were actually fake wood or plastic.  Most of my generation believes wood products destroy trees and are bad for the environment.   I hope the industry will pass the Hardwood Checkoff and run the kind of ads the paper industry is running.  I  also suggest the industry run these on Pinterest and HGTV where many of my friends go to get product ideas.

I am writing on behalf of AJD Forest Products to express our continued opposition to the proposed Hardwood Lumber Check Off tax.   We can not imagine a &quot;Check Off Board&quot; developing a marketing plan that would benefit our business.<br/><br/>The diversity of hardwood species, diversity of species characteristics and diversity of hardwood usage makes comparisons of a Hardwood Lumber Check Off to check off programs for homogeneous farm grown commodities impossible.<br/><br/>Marketing our hardwood lumber products is not an issue we see as limiting our viability and growth. However, if we must divert marketing funds we are currently spending very effectively to a socialistic collective spending money on what is best for the &quot;Check off Board&quot; we will have a business problem to address.<br/><br/>As a company, AJD Forest Products has stated its opposition to proposed Hardwood Lumber Check Off tax during every comment period and subsequent extended periods.  <br/><br/>It is time to let the industry reject this proposal.  Get the proposed Hardwood Checkoff to a vote.

Having spent an entire career at Pike Lumber Company, I understand the value of research, promotion, and information<br/>that a check-off program would bring to the hardwood industry. As stated in earlier comments I strongly support the check-off <br/>program.<br/>As a fully integrated hardwood manufacturer from growing and managing forest land through logging, sawmilling, kiln drying<br/>warehousing, and distributing, I recognize the need to include the hardwood plywood industry with hardwood lumber since we<br/>both rely on the hardwood resource for our products.  The hardwood plywood industry does not compete with the lumber<br/>industry but rather compliments it in bringing value to the hardwood resource.  Projects that specify hardwood plywood usually <br/>also use hardwood solids from lumber and gives designers an alternative to competing raw materials such as concrete, plastic,<br/>glass, and steel.

To Whom It May Concern:<br/>My name is Leo Vaughn. I have worked for Fred Netterville Lumber Company for thirty-nine years. Our company will be included in the Hardwood Checkoff and I personally support it. Hardwood lumber manufacturing is a strong, reliable US industry and has been for centuries. However, we currently face challenges from competing products better able to fund promotion, marketing, and new product development. We are not an industry made up of huge corportations. We must come together as so many other industries have done and pass a checkoff. <br/>Sincerely,<br/>Leo Vaughn<br/>

I am President and CEO of Resources First Foundation, and I strongly and whole heartedly endorse approval of the Hardwood Lumber and Plywood Promotion, Research and information Order.<br/><br/>I live and work in Maine, an important hardwood forest state.<br/> <br/>The U.S. has the healthiest hardwood forests in the world and Maine has the healthiest forests of any U.S. state, over 17.5 million acres (16.258 million are privately owned); it is no coincidence that our forests are healthy and productive. Maine also hosts the largest conservation easement acreage of any state (2,338,266 acres). Earlier in my career I worked on the Pingree easement (762,000 acres and the Downeast Lakes easement (342,000 acres). The Pingree family which owns Seven Islands Land Company has two hardwood mills in northern Maine, which are operating profitably in large part due to a successful marketing strategy.<br/><br/>My foundation, Resources First Foundation hosts over 3,200 consulting foresters nation-wide. We believe in promoting sustainable forestry and supporting the businesses dependent on US forests. The Hardwood check off is a long overdue mechanism to promote and expand markets for American hardwoods. This is critically important for an industry still facing a steep recovery from the 2008 housing/financial collapse.

I am the Executive Director of the Missouri Forest Products Association (MFPA) and I represent over 350 forest products industries in Missouri.  My membership is primarily comprised of small to medium sized sawmills, logging companies, and secondary manufacturing firms.  MFPA membership is 100% in opposition to the Hardwood Lumber and Hardwood Plywood Promotion checkoff that is being proposed by the USDA.  The proposed checkoff should be eliminated completely, no revisions will be found suitable for our membership.  <br/><br/>It seems fundamentally wrong to force an industry to support a government program that they do not believe in and do not believe that they will receive a direct benefit.  I completely understand that USDA is responding to a group of forest products industry owners that brought the concept of a checkoff forward for consideration.  Unfortunately, this group did not adequately gather the thoughts of the entire industry prior to submission of their concept.  MFPA members want to speak for themselves, and the message is loud and clear, we do not want or need a checkoff.<br/><br/>If USDA does not have the wisdom to &quot;pull&quot; this order from consideration, then we should quickly move forward to a vote.  The vote must be fair, which is one company should receive one vote, regardless of reported sales figures and volume produced.  This process is now approaching 2 years and it has become a divisive issue within the industry, it is time to move on.

Upon first glance I have a few questions and suggestions. <br/><br/>1- Overall there seems to be a lack of understanding in regards to hardwood and hardwood manufacturing. Hardwood plywood and hardwood lumber are separate products competing for the same end use. For these to be linked is counterintuitive. Plywood and lumber compete for the same resources and final sales. In many cases plywood frame stock has replaced many interior components of solid lumber. As I read the proposed order, engineered flooring will be excluded. Is there a chance engineered flooring will receive the upside of marketing because of the lack of consumer education?<br/><br/>2- In the proposed order it calls for research of our resources. This information is readily available through the Forest Service. Is it necessary to reproduce what has already been done?<br/><br/>3- By exempting log export sales the USDA will be encouraging the added value to products to be done in other countries thus meaning a loss of US jobs. Is that the mission or goal of the USDA?<br/><br/>4- Furniture products are non assessed unless the furniture manufacturer dries their own lumber which meets the definition of a &quot;hardwood manufacturer.&quot; Are they apart of the vote? Will they be notified? If so, in what form will they be notified?<br/><br/>5- Exports are included but imports are excluded. Is there a possibility importers will benefit from this proposal?<br/><br/>6- Everything 3A will be taxed, but furniture is excluded. Therefore if 1Common goes to a furniture factory will it be included or excluded?<br/><br/>7- Lastly, is it possible to get someone with industry knowledge to write this proposal so that we might avoid unintended consequences to well meaning intentions?

&quot;I spent over 10 years working in the lumber and paper industry.  During that time I saw firsthand the need to keep the entire forest business chain healthy so that all sectors could grow and succeed.  Last month I was gratified to see the wonderful ad campaign sponsored by the Paper Checkoff promoting paper and packaging - something I had never seen at that level in forest products.  The hardwood lumber industry is smart to have pursued a checkoff program, just as paper, softwood and Christmas trees have done.  I hope USDA will continue its commendable work on this project and allow the industry to vote it in as soon as possible. Thank you for considering my comments.&quot; <br/><br/>

Hardwood Lumber and Hardwood Plywood Promotion, Research and Information Order<br/>Proposed Rule <br/>Comment from Mr. John Williams, CEO, Domtar, Inc.<br/>My name is John Williams and I am CEO of Domtar, Inc. headquartered in Fort Mill, South Carolina.  Domtar designs, manufactures, markets and distributes a wide variety of wood fiber-based products, including communication papers, specialty and packaging papers, and absorbent hygiene products.   In 2014, Domtar had sales of $5.6 billion from some 50 countries. The Company employs approximately 9,800 people.  I offer comments on behalf of Domtar in strong support of the proposed Hardwood Checkoff Program and applaud the United States Department of Agriculture for moving forward with this proposal.  I urge the United States Department of Agriculture to allow this program to go to an industry vote as soon as practical.  <br/>In late 2013, the paper and paper-based packaging segment of the forest products industry voted overwhelmingly to adopt an USDA check-off program. It became effective on January 23, 2014 and I have the privilege of chairing the Board that is overseeing and directing our new initiative. This program, in a short period, has exceeded expectations in reaching end customers and users of our products.  <br/>Domtar is a significant user of hardwood residual materials.  I believe a hardwood check-off program will go a long way toward bettering the outreach, messaging and financial gain of both the hardwood industry, as well as the entire forest products industry.<br/>Within the forest products industry, the hardwood sector shares similar positions to the paper and packaging sector.  Consumer and customer misconceptions and increased competition are seen as factors in a significant decline in hardwood sales.  Individual companies are fighting this decline on their own, but their influence will be limited at best. For the same reasons it was the right decision for the paper industry, I view the establishment of a check-off program for the hardwood segment as the best way to combat diminishing sales. The larger audience, unified message, and greater financial gain of a check-off program are exactly what the hardwood industry needs.<br/> A hardwood check-off program will also help to unify the nation&#39;s forest products industry.  A unified industry - one in which paper, softwood lumber, and hardwood have all established check-off programs - would offer a face of resilience and endurance to the public never before seen.<br/>As a member of the forest products industry, the hardwood industry is facing the same marketing and communications challenges as the paper and packaging sectors. I hope the hardwood industry will be allowed to pass a vote in favor of a Checkoff program to effectively compete and resume its important and rightful place in the mix of forest products consumers choose.<br/><br/>Thank you for this opportunity to comment.<br/><br/>John D. Williams, President and CEO<br/>Do

After reading the revisions I still remain strongly opposed to the proposal. The initial plan was flawed, cumbersome and poorly written. The changes to the proposed order has only revised the ineptitude and made it more difficult to understand. The language is written in a manner to confuse readers and ultimately voters. Many of the initial questions remain unaddressed even after an industry webinar.<br/><br/>For example review the voting process. &quot;USDA is proposing to modify the referenda criteria as specified in the November 2013 proposed rule in paragraphs (a) and (b) of proposed 1211.81 to require approval by a majority of manufacturers voting in the referendum who also represent a majority of the volume (board foot or equivalent) of covered hardwood, represented in the referendum and by those who, during a representative period determined by the Secretary, were engaged in the manufacturing of covered hardwood.&quot;<br/><br/>This language is absurd. The USDA is asking to help an industry but can&#39;t give a clear understanding of how the votes will be counted. My question is simple; is the voting process one vote for one company or weighted?<br/><br/>If the USDA can&#39;t clearly state how the voting process will be handled then they are in no position to have influence regarding the direction of this industry.

Virginia Forest Products Association represents over 300 forest products industries conducting business in the Commonwealth of Virginia.  Our membership is primarily comprised of independently owned and operated small to medium sized sawmills, logging companies, and secondary manufacturing companies. The VFPA membership, as polled in February 2015, is 98% in opposition to the proposed Hardwood Lumber and Hardwood Plywood Promotion Checkoff.  As the proposal has been highly controversial, divisional and damaging to a previously close-knit industry, the proposed Checkoff should be terminated immediately, as no revisions will be found acceptable for those split by this Order. <br/><br/>At the core of the opposition to the proposed program, our membership does not embrace the Checkoff program nor have they evidence supporting a direct benefit to their businesses.  While the USDA has responded to a select group of industry members&#39; calling for the Checkoff, prior industry polling (National Hardwood Lumber Association)  has concluded an overall distaste for a mandatory program.  The industry has local, statewide, and national marketing and promotional organizations to chose from (i.e. National Hardwood Lumber Association and American Hardwood Export Council) for domestic and export marketing programs.  Various other trade organizations represent groups by regions and species (i.e. Virginia Forest Products Association and Appalachian Hardwood Manufacturers) to increase awareness of the highly specialized uses of a select hardwoods among the many existing.  Forced participation into the proposed Hardwood Checkoff program would have detrimental affects upon these preexisting organizations.  Of note - voluntary contributions to alternative promotion programs are often credited to assessment payments within commodity Checkoff programs; such is NOT the case for the proposed Hardwood Checkoff.<br/> <br/>The membership of Virginia Forest Products Association remains opposed to the current proposed Hardwood Checkoff and requests either 1) the immediate termination of this Order with limitations on minimum industry acceptance prior to resubmission or 2) a fair and equitable immediate industry vote.  <br/><br/>Susan R. Jennings<br/>President<br/>Virginia Forest Products Association<br/>

i fundamentally opposed to the Hardwood Checkoff.  Forcing a tax on everyone to benefit a few is not what checkoffs were suppose to accomplish.  The hardwood industry is too diverse and if these large companies want to spend their money on research and promotion that is what they should do.  The company I work for spend lots of money on research and promotion already and we are small enough part of the hardwood industry that our money for the program would only go to promote their products not our own.  These companies that propose this are wanting to tax everyone to pay for what is just part of business for everyone else.  I know that checkoff&#39;s can be very valuable tool in industries that have very specific products. Unlike the beef industry the hardwood industry is not all selling similar products and it is not even possible to take the money you will collect and make it apply to research and promotion to benefit every producer in the industry.  I feel that the program if passed would need to be narrowed to a more like group of producers.  It is very similar to saying you are going to have a checkoff for the vehicle industry.  Large tractor trailers do not have the same research and promotion needs as the economy car industry.  If it comes to a vote I feel that it should be one company one vote.  I have great concerns with this as well as my company was only notified about the promotion through the MFPA we were not contacted by the USDA so how would you know if every  company would even get to vote.  I think the rule need more work and needs to be a narrower group to be as truly effective as some of the other programs that have shown to be effective.<br/>

While I was in college I worked on a project related to hardwood lumber and became aware of the deficiency this industry has in the areas of marketing, promotion, and new product development.    Now as prospective first-time homebuyer I see firsthand the gaps in information available on hardwood products and the increasing use of laminate, tile, and composite products.  Checkoff programs have been the answer for so many commodities I have to think the same approach would work for hardwood.  Kudos to the industry for staying with this idea.  I&#39;ll look forward to seeing the results when the program is up and running.

My name is David Gilliam. I&#39;ve worked as a project engineer in the hardwood lumber industry for 30 years, the past 17 for Northland Forest Products. I have witnessed how the milk, beef, soybean, and pork industries have benefitted from checkoff programs, and I am convinced that a similar program for hardwood lumber is necessary to educate the next generation of consumers in the value that American hardwood lumber represents. No other material is sustainable and offers the beauty, character, and versatility of solid hardwood. Our industry is fragmented and without a solid front the story is not going to be told to the ones who are making purchasing decisions.  A checkoff program can have a positive effect on the future of the hardwood industry by assuring people that hardwood is a good choice.

It is shame we are having to revote this issue,  When is no going to mean no.  You can sugar coat it, white wash it, or call it anything you want but it is another way to get money out of small companies. Every reason has been given in favor of this program but I believe the truth is not a company our size will be represented on the governing board.  It will more than likely be made up of companies that don&#39;t even own a sawmill just want to control the hardwood industry.  I vote no.

I am opposed to the use of a check off program for the hardwood industry. Our industry is very diverse with strong relationships around the world. We have proven time and again that a strong US economy or a strong international economy will move all the material that we can produce. Our problem is not in the promotion of our products, it is the continued rising costs to operate our businesses. This check off would only add to the cost to operate. We really do not need more government in our lives. Please consider this a vote against the Hardwood Lumber and Plywood Promotion.

There is a standard all divisions of government should adopt: PRUDENCE.<br/><br/>Rather than making aggressive and too often self-serving changes, we ought to consider what is PRUDENT?, what is REASONABLE?, and of course, how will our actions affect future generations?<br/><br/>We know that we have exploited and damaged the Earth in places in a way that is going to require future generations to clean up after us---MANY future generations (consider, for instance---just as one example---the PCBs left behind in the silt of the magnificent Hudson River by General Electric Company. What a predicament! Can&#39;t leave the problem alone and can&#39;t clean it up, at least not with current technology---what a PREDICAMENT!). Is it really in our BEST INTEREST to steal the birthright of many future generations---at least, quite honestly, any more so than we already have?<br/><br/>Do we really need to complicate the lives of generations even yet unborn? Is that fair? isn&#39;t living life complicated enough, even without paying off a tremendous debt left by our forebears?<br/><br/>Growing food without the use of enduring pesticide residues is simply a PRUDENT practice, that benefits anyone who eats such produce, and protects our Earth from untenable accretions of poisons.<br/><br/>I urge the National Organics Standards Board to maintain PRUDENT and healthy standards, and certainly to tighten standards wherever we discover we are taking lazy and potentially dangerous shortcuts. Keep the BACKBONE in your policy.

I am disclosing that I am a strong supporter of the Beyond Pesticides Position that they have so clearly outlined in their<br/>comments re the NOSB.  I have read their comments, and am fully in support of their position.  I marvel at how well they<br/>have lent clarity to  the  issues that may be decided at this meeting.  I have had some experience with the failure to be transparent regarding the inerts that are prevalent in so many chemicals and other additives.  Transparency is an absolute necessity to continue maintaining and building  trust in this very important concept of organic. Its also an absolute necessity in continuing the education of our farmers and our consumers as well as all the middlemen between them.<br/>I realize that this is hard work, but it is necessary work, and as a taxpayer I expect those who represent government and are<br/>well paid to pay close attention to what people, lie Beyond Pesticides, and others  are saying who are trying so hard to maintain the integrity of this system.

I buy organic for me and my family because organic contains fewer harmful substances like pesticides, and because its production does not affect the environment as badly &#39;as regular&#39; food production. Therefore, I am very interested in keeping the standard for organic as high as possible. <br/>Any additional &#39;inert&#39; substances and synthetic additives have no place in the label organic. The very word &#39;inert&#39; is misleading, as many chemicals can do harm without reacting with other substances in an obvious manner. <br/><br/>Organic is organic, and it should stay that way. No watering down of the very good label &#39;organic.&#39;

Re: Humic Acids<br/><br/>Dear Advisory Committee,<br/><br/>We are an organic pecan grower and processor in southern Arizona. Humic materials play a key role in our organic fertility program. Humic molecular structure enables larger water holding capacities in the soil and makes nutrients (especially phosphorous) available from our compost that we apply. Additionally, the water holding capacity of humic molecules assists in leaching our salts that we encounter in our high pH western soils.This same characteristic also increases our irrigation efficiency and maximizes our applied water. Humic materials continue to improve our soil structure by providing a carbon source for micro organisms and over all soil health. We encourage the committee to allow the use of humic acids in organic production.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/>Brian Driscoll<br/>Farm Manager<br/>Farmers Investment Co./Green Valley Pecan<br/>PO Box 217<br/>San Simon, AZ 85632<br/>bdriscoll@greenvalleypecan.com

My name is Rolando Soto small organic pineapple producer located in Costa Rica, Heredia province, and canton of Sarapiqui, I am associated with that unionizes Agronorte and Coopeproagro. They are small organic producers mainly pineapple. I grow organic pineapple for 7 years and this adventure that started several of our colleagues has been fraught with problems and lack of products has caused many small farmers to desist from developing environmentally friendly agriculture and health.<br/>Organic pineapple farming is the way to meet our economic needs and therefore no use of ethylene in this activity would lead to closure of all small projects by the following:<br/>We do not know other alternative with  the effectiveness of flowering as ethylene.<br/>Less effective pollution caused by planting steady income.<br/>Uniformity in the crop is vital for the proper marketing and project profitability.<br/>When growing organic pineapple something very new constant research to have alternatives in production, a situation that is starting just necessary. Increased farmers to research and marketing of inputs is profitable for providers is needed. Ethylene removal would kill an activity before you take your adolescence.<br/>The application of ethylene planting is harmless and does not cause pollution and affect the safety of the fruit.<br/>Ethylene remove organic pineapple would be sacrificing a market that is just beginning.<br/><br/>I appreciate the consideration of my comments to continue using the ethylene flowering of pineapple<br/>

I am a mother of a young son who has food sensitivity issues. Switching to only organics has made a significant improvement to his life and health.  Please keep Organics STRONG and protected.<br/><br/>Keep the integrity of Organic items intact. The following are four things that need to be studied and/or in-acted to keep organic products safe.<br/><br/>Synthetic methionine should be phased out of organic poultry feed as the NOSB originally decided. Methionine is an amino acid that acts as a growth promoter (comparable to the synthetic growth promoter rGBH used in dairy cows). The new proposal increases use instead of increasing space and outdoor access, and alternative feed sources without any scientific support. Neither synthetic amino acids nor synthetic growth promoters are compatible with organic practices. The phase out requires an expiration date. Learn more here.<br/><br/>Nonorganic agricultural ingredients in organic products should be eliminated based on health and environmental impacts and the ability to produce them organically. Documentation for decisions has been lacking, including environmental and health impacts of pesticides used in their production. Organic agriculture can now supply most, if not all, of these materials. Learn more here.<br/><br/>Inert ingredients in pesticides used in organic production must be individually reviewed without further delay, according to processes recommended by the NOSB. So-called inert ingredients in pesticide products are neither chemically nor biologically inert, but designed to enhance the pesticidal activity of pesticide products and can have toxic properties that do not meet the standards of the Organic Foods Production Act (OFPA). Learn more here.<br/><br/>Organic should be chlorine-free, to the extent possible. Chlorine is hazardous in its production, transportation, storage, use, and disposal. EPAs Design for the Environment has identified safer viable alternatives for some or all uses, including other materials on the National List. It is time for the NOSB to update its thinking and approach to cleaners and disinfectants.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/>Connie Oglesby

There are far too many exceptions on organic food. The idea of organic food was not to benefit the industry. It was to eat cleaner food. How can we, who are not farmers, live better lives, when those of you who are specialists are not strict enough to advocate on our behalf?<br/><br/>In the meantime, why isn&#39;t it required that everything that has the USDA Certified Organic logo on it be labeled with EVERYTHING that has been used on it up until the point it reaches the retailer?<br/><br/>We deserve to know that bananas are with ethylene, one of the less troublesome allowances. OR sulfur dioxide may be present. Why is not a sign required in every retailer&#39;s store in full view of every counter that holds produce revealing that the produce has such and such on it or was treated with such and such even though it evaporated?<br/><br/>It&#39;s our right to know. <br/><br/>The biggest problem with not having a labeling requirement for every showcase of every retailer of organics is that retailers have no idea what&#39;s on the produce, so we can&#39;t ask the retailer. Retailers are not required to give a phone number of a producer or finisher, so, most of the time, we have to go hunting the number down to call them and they end up saying they don&#39;t even know what&#39;s in the combination chemical they use from such and such a company. So the poor consumer who calls about only 1 piece of produce a day has to endure 5-10 phone calls to get one answer and rarely gets an answer at all. <br/><br/>What if we are allergic to xantham gum? How will we know whether there is any present? OR what if we choose not to eat produce that has xantham gum? How are we to know?<br/><br/>Please help by making producers pass on their pesticide, herbicide, fungicide, wax/coating list. And then there&#39;s beeswax. Can&#39;t we make a rule that animal product must be labeled as such so that we can choose our produce without 10 phone calls for one piece of produce a day? <br/> <br/>Thank you for your help.

Organic products are a priority choice for me due to the prevalance of chemicals, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers in all non-organic products.  I made a conscious choice to stay away from these materials for better health for myself and those I love.  <br/><br/>According to the Organic Foods Production Act, a synthetic substance may only be allowed for use in organic production if it meets the following criteria [7 USC 6517(c)(1)(B)]:<br/><br/>It contains an active synthetic ingredient in the following categories: copper and sulfur compounds; toxins derived from bacteria; pheromones, soaps, horticultural oils, fish emulsions, treated seed, vitamins and minerals; livestock parasiticides and medicines and production aids including netting, tree wraps and seals, insect traps, sticky barriers, row covers, and equipment cleansers.<br/>It contains synthetic inert ingredients that are not classified by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency as inerts of toxicological concern.<br/><br/>Additionally, it must be fully established that the use of the substance [7 USC 6517(c)(1)(A)]:<br/><br/>would not be harmful to human health or the environment;<br/>is necessary to the production or handling of the final product because natural substitutes are not available; and<br/>is consistent with organic farming and handling<br/><br/>We must keep organic strong in order to save the bees, maintain biodiversity and clean water, and keep the air clean, all of which are protected by organic standards.

WHEN THE IDEA OF ORGANICS WAS STARTED IT WAS TO GET BACK TO THE WAY FOOD WAS RAISED(NO MAN MADE CHEMICALS ) ORGANIC IS BEING DONE NOT FOR THE PROFIT OF A BUSINESS BUT FOR THE SAKE OF HUMAN HEALTH. AND THIS IS WHAT IS THE MOST TROUBLING OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS INVOLVEMENT IN ITS RULES AND REGULATION WHEN AN ORGANIZATION CAN SAY ITS LEGAL TO CALL ICE MILK- ICE CREAM I BELIEVE THEY CAN DESTROYER THE REASON THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN GOING TO ORGANICS.  THEY TRUST THAT THEY ARE NOT BEING FOOLED BY CORPORATIONS INTO THE IDEA THAT ITS SAFE WHEN ITS NOT. ORGANIC IS NO FOREIGN CHEMICALS ADDED PERIOD NO MANIPULATING GENES SO THAT THE INSECT KILLER IS WITHIN OR PLANTS THAT CAN TAKE HERBICIDE  AND NOT SHOW IT AND CHEMICALS IN OUR MEATS.

Nonorganic agricultural materials allowed in organic processing and handling are listed as 205.606.  This is to urge you to<br/> eliminate Nonorganic Agricultural Ingredients in organic products, based on health and environmental impacts and the ability <br/>to produce them organically. Many of these materials have never been subject to a technical review. In many cases, the <br/>NOSB gave no documentation for decisions, with reviews uniformly ignoring environmental and health impacts of their <br/>chemical-intensive agricultural production, including the use of pesticides. Additionally, organic agriculture can now supply <br/>most, if not all, of these materials.

Dear Sir/Madam. I live in NZ but purchase organic foods from the USA. Far too much control is being put n the hands of companies like Monsanto and they need to be stopped from excluding organic providers and other smaller food producers in the US and other countries from earning a dollar. Also, Monsanto are in to genetic engineering. There is enough research to say that this is too risky for humans to venture in to. Neonicatinoids are another big threat and systemic pesticides which affect bees. Organic farming does not harm the environment this way o must be protected.

I oppose the proposal to classify laminarin as nonsynthetic, which would permit its use without examination of hazards. <br/>Not only do I believe that the manufacturing process qualifies this material as a synthetic material, but there are also issues <br/>of health and safety that the Board should evaluate as it moves forward in determining whether these materials should be <br/>recommended for allowance in organic production. Laminarin is extracted from seaweed and is also found in fungi. <br/>Laminarin works by amplifying natural plant defenses and by increasing the concentration of anti-herbivore and antifungal <br/>metabolites, such as the toxic chemical solanine in potatoes. The subcommittee has not addressed the issue of whether <br/>laminarin and seaweed extracts might result in levels of exposure to plant-defensive chemicals that could prove toxic to <br/>consumers, but also result in levels of exposure that are toxic to pollinators.

I rely on the organic label to have integrity, and the standards it represents to provide the purest possible products without unnecessary or potentially harmful synthetics.  I buy organics not only for the health of my body but for the health of the environment, and so it is important to me that the organic products I buy do not contain ingredients that can be harmful to me or the environment.  If organic standards become watered down so that I cannot count on these simple guarantees, I will no longer spend the extra money to buy organic certified products.  Please protect organic standards for the people that buy organic products and so those who make quality organic certified products will continue to get my business.

The soaps kill aphids and greatly improve in wetting the leaves. <br/><br/>Chlorine dioxide and Ozone are potentially important tools for preserving our potatoes in storage.<br/><br/>Ethylene is a naturally-occuring compound we may need for managing stored potatoes. <br/><br/>Humic acids:  These are derived from natural sources and can be effective at enhancing plant growth, and increasing the efficiency at which plants use soil nutrients. <br/><br/>Calcium chloride is useful for maintaining internal quality of fruits and vegetables. I don&#39;t know how effective other calcium products are, but most are derived from Calcium chloride. <br/><br/>Citric acid may be useful for us as a tool for solublizing phosphate rock powder to create readily available phosphorous for our crops. <br/><br/>Thank you.<br/>Bill Swanson<br/>Skagit Valley Farm

Please do your best to keep our National Organic Standards as strong as possible.  Looking at some of the other comments, I understand that the limitations must be practical.  I do not agree with banning clear plastic wrapping, because some products require wrapping and if consumers cannot see the product they will likely not purchase it.  I believe that would severely reduce the sale of those products, and limit the products available.<br/><br/>

I am Eng. Christian Herrera, General Manager  of Coopeproagro R. L,   a  21 growers  coop of organic pineapple production,  located in the norht plains of San Carlos county,  in northern Costa Rica... Our coop  is actually growing 125 acres of certified organic pineapple  for exports to the U.S and Europe  as well....    <br/> Conventional Pineapple  Production is  a very intense operation  even with its  crop protection package  that includes all kind of chemical controls.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>And when refferring to organic pineapple production, its  much more challenging to growers since being  a humid tropical region  the pressure  the crop has on pests and diseases is  much bigger,  with a very narrow choice of options for nutrition and pests control  .    <br/>In pineapple, flower induction in organic production, had been done with ethylene gas which is now our only option.   The ethylene is used  mixed with active charcoal ( as an inoquate transport  agent ) ,  so the plantation flowers all even, so controlled harvest can be done 22 weeks after flower induction. <br/>Ethylene use in pineapple  is one of the safeties applications on crop, very unlikely to  raise a workers hazzard or environmental risk .<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>So far there is NO RESEARCH, being held to look after substitutes, since its used is not questioned  due to hazards risk to field personnel nor environment. <br/><br/>Its our clear position to support the use of Ethylene in organic production since its the only option there is so far.    Not having Ethylene will definitively mean the end of our business and the loss of 200 employees in the most needed region of the northern plains of Costa Rica.

Farm Name:  Pias Orgnicas SOGO S.A.<br/><br/>Location (state and/or Country):  Costa Rica<br/><br/>Your e-mail:  luisgonza@ice.co.cr<br/><br/>1.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Do you or the growers you work with utilize ethylene gas for regulation of pineapple flowering?: <br/>If correct, ethylene is the only practical means of obtaining homogeneous organic pineapple flowering.<br/><br/>2.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>How and when is ethylene gas used on your farm or on the farms you work with?:<br/> Ethylene gas is applied 6 months before harvest of the fruit, or 8 months after planting pineapple. This is applied with a small tank mixture sprayed with water carrier and activated carbon to try to retain the gas and the maximum hours of low temperature  to gas does not volatilize very quickly and can make the effect of inducing bloom.<br/><br/>3.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Why is ethylene gas necessary for the success of your farm&#39;s production or the production of the farms you work with?:<br/>Ethylene is very important because it is the only way to standardize production, also to program customer sales.<br/>If you do not use ethylene to induce flowering of pineapple, flowers appear only when there is short photoperiod and low temperatures, a condition that occurs only in December so there would only be fruits six months later, i.e. in June and only this month because all would bloom in December. Thus we cannot supply the market every week as I do and would have to leave this small business because in this way it would not be profitable.<br/>I am producer of organic pineapple, agronomist and producer this fruit since 2001 and have tried to achieve positive effects of floral induction and other natural options have failed, induction of flowering in pineapple is decisive to achieve close 98-99% effectiveness of floral induction is mandatory, however when this practice is not efficient and is achieved only 90% is not business, it cannot produce organic pineapple, or the price would have to rise proportionally, we have many lost by disease, insects and the high cost of organic inputs. <br/>It&#39;s a shame to stop producing so exquisite and healthy pineapple.<br/>4.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Do you have any other thoughts on the necessity of ethylene gas in production of organic pineapples?:<br/>In Costa Rica about 50 000 hectares of conventional pineapples are grown, and less than 1000 hectares organic pineapple, and many of these are aimed at the industry.<br/>If we cannot use the ethylene we could not produce organic pineapple, and the market would lose the opportunity to consume these. Producing this pineapple is not easy so the few existing areas, without the ethylene would be impossible to do.<br/>I think that NOSB put out the list of approved ethylene should ensure that there are alternative substitutes natural inputs not go against projects close existing organic pineapple.<br/>The option to leave

  Inerts. Beyond Pesticides strongly opposes the proposed annotation of the listings for so-called &quot;inert&quot; ingredients in a way that abdicates NOSB responsibility for reviewing any synthetic substance used in organic. &quot;Inert&quot; ingredients in pesticide products are often neither chemically nor biologically inert. They can have toxic properties that may not meet the standards of the Organic Foods Production Act (OFPA). The Crops and Livestock Subcommittees have proposed to allow all chemicals listed on EPA&#39;s Safer Chemical Ingredients List to be used as &quot;inert&quot; ingredients in organic production. The NOSB should: (1) Reject the proposed annotation change; (2) Tell USDA not to change the listing of &quot;inerts,&quot; unanimously approved by the NOSB in 2012; (3) Implement the review plan approved unanimously by the board in 2012; (4) Amend the listing to remove toxic nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs); and (5) Make changes only to hasten the review of so-called &quot;inerts.&quot;<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Policy and Procedures Manual Revisions. Beyond Pesticides opposes revisions to the NOSB Policy and Procedures Manual (PPM) that take power away from the NOSB and the public and reduce transparency in oversight of organic production. The law gives independent powers to the NOSB because of concerns that USDA would not honor organic principles. But the revisions take power away from the NOSB and create increased secrecy in the decision making process and less transparency of information used. The NOSB must demand to vote on changes, based on a redlined version, an annotated table of contents that indicates which sections have been moved or changed, and an explanation and justification of each change. Changes that take power away from the NOSB or reduce transparency should be rejected.<br/><br/> Ancillary Substances. Beyond Pesticides opposes all three proposals on ancillary substances -microorganisms, pectin, and yeast- because they are inconsistent with OFPA and the process adopted by the NOSB for review of synthetic substances. Ancillary substances -those ingredients within ingredients that generally do not appear on labels- must, according to both OFPA and NOSB policy, be reviewed according to OFPA criteria. Instead, the Handling Subcommittee appears to be allowing all those currently in use, as well as new chemicals in the same functional class, and allowing toxic chemicals like formaldehyde to be added to organic food. The NOSB must reject all three ancillary ingredients proposals and demand that all ancillary ingredients be evaluated according to organic standards in the law.<br/><br/> Micronutrient Annotation. Beyond Pesticides opposes the annotation change proposed by the Crops Subcommittee (CS) because it encourages the use of synthetic micronutrients without evidence that demonstrates need.

Good government requires that regulations be backed up by reference to legal criteria.  Natural (nonsynthetic) materials that <br/>are prohibited in organic crop production are listed on 205.602. Some of the materials on 602 are prohibited from use in <br/>organic production directly by OFPA, and others, it appears, are listed based on common sense.  Therefore, it is pleasing to <br/>see that several of the materials on 602 have been supported by checklists. Before the next meeting, such justification <br/>should be produced for the remaining materials. Finally, although tobacco dust/nicotine sulfate is no longer available for sale <br/>in the United States, it should remain on 602 to discourage use of homemade tobacco dust.

As an Agriculture business owner I would hope that we could continue to have Or Cal&#39;s Lime Sulfur available to us in the Organic and Non Organic markets.  Lime Sulfur as a Dormant spray and as an In Season use product plays a major role in the quality of fruit we over see and the positive results as a Pest Control Agent that farmers depend upon.  It also helps us reduce use of In Season fungicides and miteicides. <br/><br/>Thank you for you unbiased decision to understand and appreciate the VALUE that Or Cal Lime Sulfur brings to the market place.<br/><br/>Sincerely;<br/><br/>Stan Rogers, Owner of Pallets for Agriculture, Inc and Reforestation Services, Inc.

The revision to the NOSB Policy and Procedures Manual is just another way to water down organic standards. The US govt. is spending way too much time trying to weaken our organic regulations instead of strengthening them. Pretty soon there won&#39;t be any difference in organic foods and foods loaded with toxic chemicals. The USDA is beholden to the chemical industry and is now going all out to weaken organic standards. This is wrong!!<br/><br/>So, I oppose revisions to the NOSB Policy and Procedures Manual (PPM) that take power away from the NOSB and the public and reduce transparency in oversight of organic production. The law gives independent powers to the NOSB because of concerns that USDA would not honor organic principles. But the revisions take power away from the NOSB and create increased secrecy in the decision making process and less transparency of information used. The NOSB must demand to vote on changes, based on a redlined version, an annotated table of contents that indicates which sections have been moved or changed, and an explanation and justification of each change. Changes that take power away from the NOSB or reduce transparency should be rejected.

We are pleased to note that the NOSB subcommittee is in favor of allowing synthetically extracted humic acids to be used in organic agriculture. Humic acid are being extracted using benign alkali solutions from a variety of natural organic humate deposits. These products have been standardized by many international organizations including Humic Products Trade Association in USA. Alkali extracted as well as biologically extracted humic acid products have been going through rigorous review by Organic Materials Review Institute and their experts   have allowed their listing for use in organic food production. We request that use of synthetic extracted humic products be continued to be allowed for use in organic foodproduction. <br/><br/>

The NOSB must reject all three ancillary ingredients proposals and demand that all ancillary ingredients be evaluated according to organic standards in the law.<br/> Micronutrient Annotation. Beyond Pesticides opposes the annotation change proposed by the Crops Subcommittee (CS) because it encourages the use of synthetic micronutrients without evidence that demonstrates need.

I strongly oppose the proposed annotation of the listings for so-called &quot;inert&quot; ingredients in a way that abdicates NOSB responsibility for reviewing any synthetic substance used in organic. &quot;Inert&quot; ingredients in pesticide products are often neither chemically nor biologically inert.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) violated the federal rulemaking process when it changed established procedures for reviewing the potential hazards and need for allowed synthetic and prohibited natural substances used in producing organic food. <br/>   The NOSB, intended to safeguard the integrity of the organic food label, was created by Congress with independent authorities that operate outside the discretion of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).<br/>    Please protect the integrity of the organic label, the law, and the standards-setting process. Protect NOSB&#39;s Independent    Authorities from USDA Interference. The USDA MUST put a moratorium on changes announced in the September 16, 2013 Federal Register (78 FR 56811, National Organic Program-Sunset Process) and in the USDA Organic Insider on March 6, 2014, and allow the public the opportunity to comment.

You have a list, unanimously approved, USE it with NO exception. There are already some products that say organic and are NOT. As a consumer I should be able to shop with confidence when choosing ORGANIC that if it&#39;s labeled ORGANIC it contains NO UNAPPROVED INERTS period. Under NO circumstances do I have confidence in the USDA and  big food to label ORGANIC correctly; MY health depends on it.

The Organization&#39;s objectives are to educate consumers about the health benefits of EPA/DHA and to collaborate with government groups, the healthcare community and the industry on issues related to omega3s, while setting high standards for our business sector. <br/><br/>GOED has learned that the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB), at its upcoming public meeting (October 26-29, 2015), is going to consider a proposal to relist fish oil in 7 CFR 205.606, the list of nonorganically produced agricultural products allowed as ingredients in or on processed products labeled as &quot;organic.&quot; Consumers who prefer organic products should have access to products made with non-organically produced fish oil, since organic fish oil does not currently exist. Thus said, GOED appreciates the opportunity to provide information to the NOSB in order for it to make an informed decision at its upcoming meeting. GOED will first provide comments related to the NOSB&#39;s six questions posed in advance of its spring meeting. Then, GOED will provide comments on the effects of fish oil on human health (i.e. efficacy and safety).  <br/>  <br/>For GOED&#39;s full comments, please see attached file.

To Xianni Sociedad  Annima, as producer of 25 Hectares (61.77 Acres) of organic pineapple in  Los Chiles,  that the ethylene gas is going to be removed from production is a big concern, because all the planning of pest control , harvesting and marketing depend on the uniformity during forcing due to ethylene gas. Currently we have no others alternatives that allow us to replace the ethylene and make the same effect of uniformity of the plantation. Moreover, so far there is no evidence of poisoning with ethylene gas because this is a natural gas.

I strongly believe in healthy food--free of pesticides and GMOs. I have learned so much and have given up dangerous products.  It is tragic and horrible that foods and products that have been deemed to be dangrous are allowed.  GMO, BPA, Aspartame and so many more things should be banned entirely.  Organic and no pesticides must be our future for the health of everyone and all current and future generations.  Pescides and GMO&#39;s are dangerous and are harming the environment, humans, animals, bees, birds, all life, trees, plants, air, soil, water and environment and must be stopped worldwide. Lobbyist should be banned, as well.

This comment is concerning regulation 205.605(b) synthetics allowed--ethylene gas spraying on produce.<br/>I have allergic contact dermatitis with exposure to propylene glycol (PG) and polyethylene glycol (PEG).  This means that even with miniscule exposure, I develop a rash, fluid-filled blisters and stomach and bowel distress.  You may already know that PG and PEG are ubiquitous, petroleum-based chemicals used extensively in the production of food, pharmaceuticals and personal care products.  Their versatility as softening agents, preservatives, humectants, emulsifiers and solvents means they can be used in virtually any/all processed foods, labeled and unlabeled.  Because of this fact and the fact that PG is sprayed on many fruits and vegetables, I buy limited processed food and all organic produce.  The reality that synthetic ethylene gas is now allowed to be sprayed on tropical and citrus organic fruits and vegetables is extremely troubling to me because I rely heavily on the assurance that USDA organic produce is safe for me.<br/><br/>I have done enough research to know that ethylene is a natural plant hormone.  I also know that the chemical formulas for natural ethylene gas and synthetically produced ethylene gas are supposedly the same.  Even though I am not a chemist, I know this is not true.  My skin does not lie and it has not allowed me to eat organic bananas, tomatoes or pineapple since my PG diagnosis, even though I was able to eat them before the development of my allergy.  My arguments in defense of this position are as follows:  1)  A correlation can be made to generic vs. trade name medicines.  Pharmaceutical companies and doctors (via medical insurance companies) say the generic is the same drug. The reality is, however, that the drugs are bioequivalent in that they have the same dosage form, safety assurance, strength, route of administration, quality, performance characteristics and intended use.  Pharmaceutical companies are required to explain the components of the generic drugs, but NOT how they are made.  The FDA has a broad definition of biological equivalence.  For example, a generic&#39;s maximum concentration of active ingredients in the blood must not fall more than 20% below or 25% above the brand name.  This leaves a potential concentration of 45% by that measure among generics labeled as being the same.  2)  I believe the same logic can be applied to the man-made ethylene.  HOW PURE IS THE ETHYLENE BEING MADE COMMERCIALLY--ESPECIALLY THE ETHYLENE BEING MADE AND USED IN THE FOREIGN COUNTRIES WHERE MANY OF OUR TROPICAL FRUITS COME FROM?  It is very likely that trace amounts of other things get into the mix, especially with multiple processes going on in producing and applying it.  The fact that the same molecule may be perceived differently at different concentrations is a distinct possibility.  Other sources of ethylene, such as exhaust fumes during transit, can also drastically raise the concentration of ethylene

NOSB/Hydroponics and Aquaponics Task Force:  I support the continued allowance of Hydroponics and Aquaponics as part of<br/> the USDA Certified Organic Program.   I believe the main point for consumers is to have animal and plant products that are <br/>raised/grown without the use of any chemicals, pesticides, steroids, man-made additives, etc....In other words, only all natural<br/>inputs.  <br/>It seems a small handful of people are pushing for the requirement of using soil and are against hydroponics and aquaponics. <br/>If a grower can get all the nutrients that the plant needs into the water (from all natural sources), and he/she ends up with a <br/>clean, healthy and nutritious plant, why should it specifically need to be grown in soil?  It doesn&#39;t make sense to require the use<br/>of soil.    Requiring the use of soil seems more like an opinion, and a preference for some people, possibly to keep old traditions <br/>in place?<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>In that case, what else should be reviewed?   Maybe metal shovels should not be allowed in organic farming, only<br/>shovels carved out of wood?  <br/>    <br/>Many years ago, the USDA recognized that modern growing methods need to be supported to keep pace with feeding<br/>the ever expanding population.   Hydroponics and aquaponics fit into this category.  They fit in with the many other agricultural<br/>advancements that have been developed through the years (and are approved for organic farming) such as tractors, <br/>mechanized farm implements, irrigation systems and greenhouses.  I urge the USDA to stay on track with this understanding <br/>of the need for progress.<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span><br/><br/>Here is an interesting comparison:<br/>The positive affects of these growing methods are far-reaching.   I spoke to a gentleman the other day who has developed<br/>a solar powered &#39;closed loop&#39; aquaponics system that he hopes to get into the hands of farmers in third world countries to help<br/>fight starvation.  His system consists of raising crickets, feeding them to fish, the water that the fish swim in flows to vegetable <br/>plants, which flourish on the nutrients provided by the fish waste.    I realize these farmers in the third world countries are not<br/>trying to become &#39;certified organic&#39; (they just want to survive), however I believe it is great example of the ultimate method of <br/>Organic Farming.   So what would the USA proponents for &#39;having to grow in soil&#39; say to these farmers?   &quot;It should not be <br/>done because _______&quot;   WHY?  What would be the argument?   <br/><br/>Please do not let a small vocal group stop what is already proven to be a viable and efficient way to produce safe healthy<br/>crops for the ever growing population.    Banning the use of Hydroponics and Aquaponics for Organic certification would<br/>be a direct negative affect to many small growers throughout North America.    Yes, there are

  Inerts. <br/>I strongly oppose the proposed annotation of the listings for so-called &quot;inert&quot; ingredients in a way that abdicates NOSB responsibility for reviewing any synthetic substance used in organic. &quot;Inert&quot; ingredients in pesticide products are often neither chemically nor biologically inert. They can have toxic properties that may not meet the standards of the Organic Foods Production Act (OFPA). The Crops and Livestock Subcommittees have proposed to allow all chemicals listed on EPA&#39;s Safer Chemical Ingredients List to be used as &quot;inert&quot; ingredients in organic production. The NOSB should: (1) Reject the proposed annotation change; (2) Tell USDA not to change the listing of &quot;inerts,&quot; unanimously approved by the NOSB in 2012; (3) Implement the review plan approved unanimously by the board in 2012; (4) Amend the listing to remove toxic nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs); and (5) Make changes only to hasten the review of so-called &quot;inerts.&quot;<br/><br/>  Policy and Procedures Manual Revisions. <br/>I oppose revisions to the NOSB Policy and Procedures Manual (PPM) that take power away from the NOSB and the public and reduce transparency in oversight of organic production. The law gives independent powers to the NOSB because of concerns that USDA will not honor organic principles. But the revisions take power away from the NOSB and create increased secrecy in the decision making process and less transparency of information used. The NOSB must demand to vote on changes, based on a redlined version, of an annotated table of contents that indicates which sections have been moved or changed, and demand an explanation and justification of each change. Changes that take power away from the NOSB or reduce transparency should be rejected.<br/><br/> Ancillary Substances. <br/>I oppose all three proposals on ancillary substances -microorganisms, pectin, and yeast- because they are inconsistent with OFPA and the process adopted by the NOSB for review of synthetic substances. Ancillary substances -those ingredients within ingredients that generally do not appear on labels- must, according to both OFPA and NOSB policy, be reviewed according to OFPA criteria. Instead, the Handling Subcommittee appears to be allowing all those currently in use, as well as new chemicals in the same functional class, and allowing toxic chemicals like formaldehyde to be added to organic food. The NOSB must reject all three ancillary ingredients proposals and demand that all ancillary ingredients be evaluated according to organic standards in the law.<br/><br/> Micronutrient Annotation. <br/>I oppose the annotation change proposed by the Crops Subcommittee (CS) because it encourages the use of synthetic micronutrients without evidence that demonstrates either need or safety. While the CS correctly points to methods other than soil testing to document soil deficiency, I disagree with the CS&#39; allowance use of synthetic micronutrie

Instead, the Handling Subcommittee appears to be allowing all those currently in use, as well as new chemicals in the same functional class, and allowing toxic chemicals like formaldehyde to be added to organic food. The NOSB must reject all three ancillary ingredients proposals and demand that all ancillary ingredients be evaluated according to organic standards in the law.<br/><br/>I strongly oppose the annotation change proposed by the Crops Subcommittee (CS) because it encourages the use of synthetic micronutrients without evidence that demonstrates need. While the CS correctly points to methods other than soil testing to document soil deficiency, we disagree with the CS&#39; allowance use of synthetic micronutrients without on-site documentation. Soil deficiency must be demonstrated by verifiable site-spec

I am a woman who has had many toxic poisonings in my life and am working hard to stay away from all chemicals. I do not want my precious organic food to contain inert chemicals! I am far from rich so the price on organic foods almost breaks me financially. I believe the purity is worth it! Please do not allow anything to be put into my organic food and make me sick. Thank you.

Maintaining organic standards is essential for those of us who want pure unadulterated produce.  No irradiation. Nothing artificial.  No additives.  This is especially vital in light of the way GM food is being foisted on us for those of us who want to protect the health and safety of our food for our families.  Every year it seems some vested interest wants to dilute organic standards and we need you to maintain those standards. Thank you.

Dear Board Members,<br/><br/>I have always been willing to pay higher prices for Organic food because I believe that it is better for my health and the environment. I have severe chemical sensitivities. I want to believe that National Organic Standards can be trusted.  I am writing to ask you to please: <br/>  1. Reject the proposed annotation change.<br/>  2. Do not change the lists of inerts approved in 2012.<br/>  3. Remove NPEs from being used.<br/><br/>USDA Organic labels need to represent food that can be trusted. We need to know that there is a Board Member group that will not allow harmful chemicals to be sprayed, or unlisted additives added to our food.  We do not want to be in the dark about what goes into our bodies.  We pay more BECAUSE WE CARE.  PLEASE CONTINUE TO BE A GROUP THAT CARES!!!<br/><br/>Thank you for listening,<br/>D. Grady  <br/>

This to urge you to reclassify alginic acid as synthetic. Although application of the draft NOP classification guidelines <br/>supports a classification of alginic acid because the salts and not the acids occur naturally in seaweeds, alginic acid should <br/>not be  listed on 205.605(b). The use of a synthetic material to improve textures in soups and soup mixes is a purpose that <br/>is not essential to the production of food, and the TR lists many natural and organic substitutes. In addition, the harvesting <br/>and processing of seaweed for alginic acid results in ecological damage.

I strongly oppose the proposed annotation of the listings for so-called &quot;inert&quot; ingredients in a way that abdicates NOSB responsibility for reviewing any synthetic substance used in organic. &quot;Inert&quot; ingredients in pesticide products are often neither chemically nor biologically inert. They can have toxic properties that may not meet the standards of the Organic Foods Production Act (OFPA). The Crops and Livestock Subcommittees have proposed to allow all chemicals listed on EPA&#39;s Safer Chemical Ingredients List to be used as &quot;inert&quot; ingredients in organic production. The NOSB should: (1) Reject the proposed annotation change; (2) Tell USDA not to change the listing of &quot;inerts,&quot; unanimously approved by the NOSB in 2012; (3) Implement the review plan approved unanimously by the board in 2012; (4) Amend the listing to remove toxic nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs); and (5) Make changes only to hasten the review of so-called &quot;inerts.&quot;

I oppose all three proposals on ancillary substances. Stop watering down our organic standards. Allowing dangerous ingredients like formaldehyde into organic foods means they are no longer organic. Ancillary ingredients need to be evaluated according to organic standards, not dismissed as benign or safe. Organic food is not supposed to contain any chemicals and that is why people buy it so the way things are going, the USDA organic label will be meaningless. Chemicals are NOT healthy for us so the peope who care about their health want the organics standards to be truthful.<br/><br/>All three proposals on ancillary substances -microorganisms, pectin, and yeast need to be rejected because they are inconsistent with OFPA and the process adopted by the NOSB for review of synthetic substances. Ancillary substances -those ingredients within ingredients that generally do not appear on labels- must, according to both OFPA and NOSB policy, be reviewed according to OFPA criteria. Instead, the Handling Subcommittee appears to be allowing all those currently in use, as well as new chemicals in the same functional class, and allowing toxic chemicals like formaldehyde to be added to organic food. The NOSB must reject all three ancillary ingredients proposals and demand that all ancillary ingredients be evaluated according to organic standards in the law.

<span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Please work faithfully to keep our National Organic Standards as strong as possible.  I feel that all of your agenda<br/>items listed on the email to which I am responding, by &quot;Consumer Reports Greener Choices&quot; are worthy of serious <br/>consideration.  Much of this concerns limiting synthetic or non-organic items allowed, in the processing at least, of &quot;organic&quot; <br/>foods.  I agree totally that all such items should be required to have extensive scientific backing as to their harmlessness.  <br/>Hopefully they must also be listed on the labels of &quot;organic&quot; food.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>I have heard both sides of the &quot;plastics&quot; issue.  Generally I am against plastics, as our oceans are quickly filling with<br/>plastic, and killing all sorts of marine life.  Hopefully some sort of compromise could be worked out.  Being a vegan, I am<br/>not certain, but I think that places which sell meat usually have it displayed in a refrigerated area, or would be willing to<br/>show the customer the meat as they cut it.  If already cut and packaged, I would expect most sellers to be willing to open<br/>a package so the customer could examine it.  If plastic is used, it should definitely be clear, not pink to hide decay.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Lastly, I fear this is not relevant to the organic standards themselves, but I wish some legal actions would be possible<br/>for organic farmers whose crops are contaminated by GMOs.  As it is, companies like Monsanto love to sue the farmers<br/>whose crops have been contaminated for &quot;patent infringement&quot;, where I feel the farmers should be able to sue Monsanto <br/>for the contamination.  Actually I don&#39;t feel that living organisms should be patentable, but that&#39;s yet another issue.

Keeping organic standards as they were originally set, based on massive consumer support, is important to enable consumers to continue to have freedom of choice over the foods we purchase and eat.  Without continuing an organic standard that does not include GMO foods, consumers are left without any possible way to determine the nature and etiology of their foods.  Little attention has been given to the changes in immune system function that is more likely than not created by the new proteins and related cell biochemistry changes that come from introducing new genes into foods.  It is shameful that a country that touts its superiority due to freedoms, is continuing to take away freedoms of right to know and right to chose what we put into our bodies.

Inerts. I strongly oppose the proposed annotation of the listings for so-called &quot;inert&quot; ingredients in a way that abdicates NOSB responsibility for reviewing any synthetic substance used in organic. &quot;Inert&quot; ingredients in pesticide products are often neither chemically nor biologically inert. They can have toxic properties that may not meet the standards of the Organic Foods Production Act (OFPA). The Crops and Livestock Subcommittees have proposed to allow all chemicals listed on EPA&#39;s Safer Chemical Ingredients List to be used as &quot;inert&quot; ingredients in organic production. The NOSB should: (1) Reject the proposed annotation change; (2) Tell USDA not to change the listing of &quot;inerts,&quot; unanimously approved by the NOSB in 2012; (3) Implement the review plan approved unanimously by the board in 2012; (4) Amend the listing to remove toxic nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs); and (5) Make changes only to hasten the review of so-called &quot;inerts.&quot;<br/><br/> Policy and Procedures Manual Revisions. I oppose revisions to the NOSB Policy and Procedures Manual (PPM) that take power away from the NOSB and the public and reduce transparency in oversight of organic production. The law gives independent powers to the NOSB because of concerns that USDA would not honor organic principles. But the revisions take power away from the NOSB and create increased secrecy in the decision making process and less transparency of information used. The NOSB must demand to vote on changes, based on a redlined version, an annotated table of contents that indicates which sections have been moved or changed, and an explanation and justification of each change. Changes that take power away from the NOSB or reduce transparency should be rejected.<br/><br/> Ancillary Substances. I oppose all three proposals on ancillary substances -microorganisms, pectin, and yeast- because they are inconsistent with OFPA and the process adopted by the NOSB for review of synthetic substances. Ancillary substances -those ingredients within ingredients that generally do not appear on labels- must, according to both OFPA and NOSB policy, be reviewed according to OFPA criteria. Instead, the Handling Subcommittee appears to be allowing all those currently in use, as well as new chemicals in the same functional class, and allowing toxic chemicals like formaldehyde to be added to organic food. The NOSB must reject all three ancillary ingredients proposals and demand that all ancillary ingredients be evaluated according to organic standards in the law.<br/><br/> Micronutrient Annotation. I oppose the annotation change proposed by the Crops Subcommittee (CS) because it encourages the use of synthetic micronutrients without evidence that demonstrates need. While the CS correctly points to methods other than soil testing to document soil deficiency, we disagree with the CS&#39; allowance use of synthetic micronutrients without on-site documentation.

Glycerin is an important ingredient used in our herb and spice pastes for its water binding, textural, and natural preservation properties.  The letter from the Organic Trade Association to the Handling Committee, dated April 7, 2015, suggested insufficient supply of organic glycerin. From our research we too have found extremely limited supply of organic glycerin in the quality, quantity and form needed for our products.  A rule change making organic glycerin compulsory, particularly in the made with organic category, would increase demand and almost certainly leave us in a situation of non-supply.  <br/><br/>Secondly the proposed rule change to reclassify glycerin as agricultural will undoubtedly place further strain on current supplies of agricultural glycerin whether made by fermentation or hydrolysis.  <br/><br/>Thirdly, a significant proportion of glycerin is sourced from soy and therefore not suitable for certain applications due to the allergenic nature of soy.  This adds a further complication and supply restriction for customer who require non-soy sources of organic glycerin and agricultural glycerin. <br/>

National Organic Standards Board<br/><br/>2017 Sunset, Sulfur Dioxide on National List at 7 CFR  205.605(b)<br/><br/>Comments of Organic Vintners, Inc., Boulder, Colorado<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Organic Vintners, Inc., founded in 2001 and based in Boulder, Colorado, imports and distributes wines made from 100% organic grapes.  Our wines come from the United States, Europe, Latin America and New Zealand.  Organic Vintners understands that the National Organic Standards Board is reviewing the listing of sulfur dioxide (sulfites) on the National List in 7 CFR  205.605(b).  This listing is set to expire on June 27, 2017, unless the Board votes to extend the listing.  This listing allows sulfur dioxide &quot;for use only in wine labeled &#39;made with organic grapes.&#39;&quot;  The total sulfite concentration may not exceed 100 ppm.  <br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>Organic Vintners strongly supports continuing this listing, and requests the National Organic Standards Board to vote to keep this allowance for sulfur dioxide. Sulfur dioxide  (sulfites) is a naturally occurring by-product of fermentation.  In addition to the sulfites that occur naturally, the wine industry the world over adds sulfites to wine in the winery to control unwanted bacteria and to preserve the quality and shelf life of the wine.<br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>It is vital to the community of organic wine grape organic growers and the organic wine industry as a whole both in the United States and throughout the world that this allowance for sulfur dioxide be continued.  The reason is that the wholly &quot;organic&quot; winemakers, those that are willing to produce their wine without the benefits of added sulfites, remain a very small group within the industry.  Even with the &quot;organic&quot; label, their wines have not achieved a significant market share.  Some would attribute this, at least in part, to the lack of added sulfites.  The vast majority of wine grapes that are grown organically for organic consumers in the United States go into wine that is under organic certification but is labeled &quot;made with organic grapes,&quot; instead of &quot;organic,&quot; because sulfites are added.  Those organic winemakers, the vast majority, believe it is absolutely necessary to add sulfites to preserve the stability and quality of the wine.    <br/><br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>If organic winemakers adding sulfites could no longer make the organic claim under the NOP, &quot;made with organic grapes,&quot; for their wines, this would decimate the existing organic wine market.  It would mean that the only wine left on the market that could make any type of &quot;organic&quot; claim would be the wholly organic wines.  Because only a handful of wineries occupy that small segment of the industry, there would be a vastly diminished market for organically grown grapes.  Countless organic vineyards would not stay

Subject: Support for continued listing of plastic mulch and covers for organic agriculture.<br/><br/>Reference: 205.601(b) As herbicides, weed barriers, as applicable. (2) Mulches. (ii) Plastic mulch and<br/>covers (petroleum-based other than polyvinyl chloride (PVC)).<br/><br/>Dear NOSB members.<br/><br/>Dole Tropical Products Latin America Ltd. , the leading grower and exporter of organic pineapples to the United States,<br/>introduces these comments in favor of the motion to maintain plastic mulch and covers on the National List for use as a <br/>mulch to control weeds in organic production.<br/><br/>Our Company sources and produces organic pineapples cultivated in Costa Rica. The organic pineapple farms must use<br/>plastic mulches to control weeds, as well as to allow for the growth of healthy root systems that can tolerate the damage<br/>caused by soil pests and diseases. <br/><br/>Since pineapples grow directly in the fields with direct exposure to sunlight, the lack of weed control is a situation that can<br/>drastically harm organic pineapple cultivation; the many weeds present in the tropical fields will quickly overtake the pineapple<br/>plants causing complete loss of the cultivated plantation.<br/><br/>Co-benefits such as pest and disease tolerance would be lost without the use of plastic mulch causing further losses and/or<br/>the need to use other materials and practices to control these additional production limitations.<br/><br/>Alternatives such as the use of bioplastics for mulches have not proven successful, as the plastic mulch must remain in place <br/>for over two years for the entire crop cycle. In Costa Rica, the plastic mulch is removed by the farm and recycled or used as<br/>an energy source in cement kilns, as approved by the Government. Environmental impact form the use of these mulches is<br/>very limited and is far outweighed by the environmental benefits afforded. Plastic mulch is the most effective method to control<br/>soil erosion in pineapple cultivation (erosion rates are basically zero), and the farming of organic pineapples actually lists this<br/>as one of the most important and sustainable practices for this crop.<br/><br/>Dole Tropical Products fully agrees with the subcommittee&#39;s vote against the motion to remove plastic mulch and covers <br/>from 205.601(b). The use of plastic mulch is an essential practice for the cultivation of organic pineapples in Costa Rica and<br/>elsewhere and the crop could not be produced without it use; farms both large and small would have to convert to <br/>conventional agriculture in order to produce a sustainable pineapple crop.<br/><br/>Sincerely yours,<br/><br/>Rudy Amador<br/>Director, Product Stewardship and Sustainable Agriculture<br/>Dole Tropical Products Latin America Ltd.<br/>Escazu, San Jose, Costa Rica<br/>rudy.e.amador@dole.com<br/>October 6th, 2015<br/>

Major issues before the fall 2015 NOSB include:<br/>The NOSB should: (1) Reject the proposed annotation change; (2) Tell USDA not to change the listing of &quot;inerts,&quot; unanimously approved by the NOSB in 2012; (3) Implement the review plan approved unanimously by the board in 2012; (4) Amend the listing to remove toxic nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs); and (5) Make changes only to hasten the review of so-called &quot;inerts.&quot;<br/>The NOSB must demand to vote on changes, based on a redlined version, an annotated table of contents that indicates which sections have been moved or changed, and an explanation and justification of each change. Changes that take power away from the NOSB or reduce transparency should be rejected.<br/>The NOSB must reject all three ancillary ingredients proposals and demand that all ancillary ingredients be evaluated according to organic standards in the law.<br/>I oppose the annotation change proposed by the Crops Subcommittee (CS) because it encourages the use of synthetic micronutrients without evidence that demonstrates need. While the CS correctly points to methods other than soil testing to document soil deficiency, I disagree with the CS&#39; allowance use of synthetic micronutrients without on-site documentation.  I AGREE WITH Beyond Pesticides, WHICH supports a different restriction, &quot;Soil deficiency must be demonstrated by verifiable site-specific documentation that is accompanied by a plan for building soil that provides adequate nutrition through soil-building practices and organic inputs.&quot;<br/>

I am writing to support the use of humic substances in Organic Agriculture. I am doing this in my capacity as a nutritionist who <br/>has conducted animal research with humic and Fulvic acids at the university. I am also a member of the International Humic <br/>Substances Society (IHSS) and a scientific committee member of the Humic Products and Trade Association. In my research <br/>work, I have  extracted humic and Fulvic acids from raw humates nearly from all over the world. The United States is by far, one <br/>of the few countries in the world that harbors some of the finest soil-base humic substances. Unlike, other parts of <br/>the world where these products are located mainly in riverbeds, lakes and caves where they&#39;re prone to exposure to acid rain, <br/>GMO&#39;s and runoff from chemically fertilized farm lands, ours are buried away in the pristine wildness of the environment. As <br/>farms are gradually over-farmed with chemical-base products, recharging of these farms with humic substances (organically) to <br/>make them sustainable would become inevitable if we want to maintain our leadership as the bread basket of the world. Also, as<br/>the demand for wholesome organically produced foods increase, it would be advantageous for us to have these unique <br/>resources in our arsenal in order to become competitive in the world. Whether we are using them in crops or for future <br/>stimulation of rumen microbes the same way as we currently do in soils, we would generate organic  foods that are very healthy<br/>for people and therefore provide us with an enviable market share of the world economy. For these and many other reasons, I <br/>support the use of humic substances in organic agriculture.

Dear Sir/Madam:<br/><br/>I am a retired civil servant who has been eating only organic food for several years.  I am writing to ask that you do not weaken organic standards in any way.  To be more specific:<br/><br/>1)Do not permit the chemicals listed on the EPA&#39;s &quot;Safer Chemical Ingredients&quot; list to receive a blanket listing as &quot;inert ingredients&quot; in organic production.  Many of these compounds may not meet the standards of the Organic Foods Production Act (OFPA).  In fact, they may have toxic properties.  Instead of allowing such substances indiscriminately, the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) should evaluate them according to the review plan which the board unanimously approved in 2012.<br/><br/>2)Do not permit revisions to the NOSB Policy and Procedures Manual that take power from the NOSB or reduce transparency in the supervision of organic production.  The OFPA grants the NOSB sole authority to, among other things, recommend adding or removing materials from the National List.  Please do not weaken that authority, and please do not increase secrecy as to how decisions are made.<br/><br/>3)Reject the proposal by the Crops Subcommittee regarding micro-nutrient annotation because this proposal makes it easier to use synthetic micro-nutrients without evidence that such micro-nutrients are needed.  Before synthetic micro-nutrients are used, there should be specific documentation of soil deficiency at each site, and a detailed explanation of why natural soil-building practices and organic nutrients are inadequate for remedying the deficiency.<br/><br/>4)Reject the proposals for the following ancillary substances: micro-organisms, pectin, and yeast.  The proposals are not based on evaluations of the substances according to criteria established by the OFPA.  Thus they violate the Act.  These proposals should also be rejected because each of them would allow additional ancillaries without any review at all.  This is not only a violation of the Act, but an insult to those who trust the organic label.   It debases the concept of &quot;organic&quot;.<br/><br/>Rather than weaken organic standards, the NOSB should strengthen them.  If it was not in the food my mom prepared, please do not permit it in the (organic) food I eat.<br/><br/>Yours truly,<br/>Matthew Lipschik<br/><br/>

  Inerts. I oppose the proposed annotation of the listings for so-called &quot;inert&quot; ingredients in a way that abdicates NOSB responsibility for reviewing any synthetic substance used in organic. &quot;Inert&quot; ingredients in pesticide products are often neither chemically nor biologically inert. They can have toxic properties that may not meet the standards of the Organic Foods Production Act (OFPA). The Crops and Livestock Subcommittees have proposed to allow all chemicals listed on EPA&#39;s Safer Chemical Ingredients List to be used as &quot;inert&quot; ingredients in organic production. The NOSB should: (1) Reject the proposed annotation change; (2) Tell USDA not to change the listing of &quot;inerts,&quot; unanimously approved by the NOSB in 2012; (3) Implement the review plan approved unanimously by the board in 2012; (4) Amend the listing to remove toxic nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs); and (5) Make changes only to hasten the review of so-called &quot;inerts.&quot;<br/><br/>Policy and Procedures Manual Revisions. I oppose revisions to the NOSB Policy and Procedures Manual (PPM) that take power away from the NOSB and the public and reduce transparency in oversight of organic production. The law gives independent powers to the NOSB because of concerns that USDA would not honor organic principles. But the revisions take power away from the NOSB and create increased secrecy in the decision making process and less transparency of information used. The NOSB must demand to vote on changes, based on a redlined version, an annotated table of contents that indicates which sections have been moved or changed, and an explanation and justification of each change. Changes that take power away from the NOSB or reduce transparency should be rejected.<br/><br/>Ancillary Substances. I oppose all three proposals on ancillary substances -microorganisms, pectin, and yeast- because they are inconsistent with OFPA and the process adopted by the NOSB for review of synthetic substances. Ancillary substances -those ingredients within ingredients that generally do not appear on labels- must, according to both OFPA and NOSB policy, be reviewed according to OFPA criteria. Instead, the Handling Subcommittee appears to be allowing all those currently in use, as well as new chemicals in the same functional class, and allowing toxic chemicals like formaldehyde to be added to organic food. The NOSB must reject all three ancillary ingredients proposals and demand that all ancillary ingredients be evaluated according to organic standards in the law.<br/><br/> Micronutrient Annotation. I oppose the annotation change proposed by the Crops Subcommittee (CS) because it encourages the use of synthetic micronutrients without evidence that demonstrates need. While the CS correctly points to methods other than soil testing to document soil deficiency, we disagree with the CS&#39; allowance use of synthetic micronutrients without on-site documentation.
